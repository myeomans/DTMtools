"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","friend_value","I value loyalty and trust the most in a friendship. I think it's very important in any close relationship. I feel like in order for us to be friends, I have to be able to trust you. With trust, then you also need loyalty. "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was today, at home. I love to sing and I am always making up silly little songs. I sing in the car, home, shower, and many other places. The last time I sang to someone else was yesterday. I sang a silly rhyming song to my daughter, which was about her."
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","garden","Well, I do have some plants and trees around my home. We have lived her around 16 years so we started planted them the first year we moved in. I have a Weeping Willow tree by the creek that was a wee tiny guy when we planted him 15 years ago. He is strong and beautiful. But, I also have many other trees and plants in my front and back yard, with many varieties. "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","fire_rescue","Well, after I saved all of my loved ones and pets, I would go back to save my great grandmother's quilt. My mother gave me this quilt when her mother had to go to the nursing home. Her mother, so my great grandmother, made the quilt many years ago. She made it from cloth scraps from the children's old clothing, sheets, etc. My grandmother passed away last year and it's very special to me, it can't be replaced. While I almost would have got a family photo album, many of those photos my mother has so I can make copies of most pictures. "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","religious","I am religious. I was raised in the church all my life. I believe there is a God, afterlife and a Heaven or Hell. I am because I like to think there is something beyond our life on this Earth and death. Something wonderful, greater and beautiful. "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","how_raised","I had a wonderful childhood and fantastic parents. My sister and I never went without and always felt loved and protected. But, if I was going to change one thing, I would change my father showing his love a bit more openly. I've always known and felt loved by my father, but he had a hard time in displays of affection. Even with my mother. He didn't get much from his parents as a child and it's hard for him to physically and verbally show affection, as he really never got it during his childhood."
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","like_work","I am a Production Control Clerk at a company. I like that it is in an office setting and there is a close group of coworkers in the office. I enjoy the work, to a point. My job entails that I have to be very attentive and accurate, more than speed. But, I try my best to do well at being attentive, accurate and fast. It's personally important to my values that I put forth my best effort in my job. "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","famous","I don't think that I would really want to be famous. But, if I was going to be famous, I would want to be famous for a talent of mine. Not so much as acting, or being a celebrity. I would like to be famous for being an author. I would want to be known in creating intriguing, funny, captivating and not-want-the-story-to-end novels."
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up would be that it was at a dead end road, very remote. One had to cross a bridge, through a closed gate and another bridge to get to our home. There were no street lights and it was pitch black at night. I loved it, but it's strange how dark it would be when you went outside, where you couldn't even see your hand in front of your face."
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","why_studies","I do online studies for a few reasons. I find them to be interesting and I enjoy them. I also like to know I am contributing in some way, that I may be helping make something better. I also enjoy a little extra pocket change. So, several reasons that I do them."
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","mind_body","I would rather have the mind of a 30 year old. My grandmother had Alzheimer's and I see how hard and sad it is to not have an active mind. She would often not know who we were, which is very tragic. I would take an active, young mind over the body any day.  "
"R_08s7LSsmaof1iQ9","cute_baby","One very cute thing I saw a baby do was with one of my own children. They were in their little walker, running around the house. They had been active and playing one moment, but the next moment I looked at them, they were laying face down on their tray, fast asleep. It was so adorable!"
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up would probably have to be that near my small town there is a haunted place.  It is supposed to be a haunted asylum called the Rolling Hills.  What makes it even creepier is that I went there one time for a sort of flea market that was hosted at that very asylum when I was very young.  They do not do that anymore, they stopped doing it shortly after I went.  It was very creepy and strange.  "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","cute_baby","When I was at my friend's house his little cousin was over.  He was just a child and every time his mother would tell him ""no"", he would get upset and jump up in the air and land on his butt.  We all thought it was so funny and cute. "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","fire_rescue","It would be my baby blanket.  Even though it is very ragged and old, I would save  that item.  It has a lot of sentimental value to me.  "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous.   I would not want to be known by a lot of people.  I like to keep to myself and live a private life."
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","how_raised","I had an amazing childhood.  I don't think there is really anything that I would change.  It was almost too good to be true, like a story out of a book."
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","why_studies","I do these online studies to learn.  Also, to make some money from Amazon Mechanical Turk.  I have found the whole experience quite positive.  "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","garden","Yes, I have a small garden with some plants.  I do not have any fruit trees however.  I grow some carrots and tomatoes in my garden in my backyard."
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","like_work","I was a tutor for middle school students.  I like interacting with the young students.  It was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.  "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","religious","No, I am not a very religious person.  I don't go to church or anything like that.  I am a very spiritual person however."
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","last_sing","I have never sang to anyone before.  I perhaps sing to myself in the shower or the car.  I'm not a very good singer at all.  "
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","mind_body","I would choose the body of a 30 year old.   I think my mind will stay sharp.  I would just want a body of a 30 year old to stay strong and healthy."
"R_0AgAAgcQ10zKLzr","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is honesty.  If you can have honesty, you can have trust.  These are the building blocks of a true friendship, if you can be honest and trust each other then it is a great friendship.  "
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","why_studies","Look at it this way: I'm here sitting bored at work, and I'm not doing anything else. So i'm making my base salary, plus whatever bonus I get from working on here. It almost feels like free extra money."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","cute_baby","Watching a baby struggle to roll over is cute to me. The helplessness of it. To think that we are all born so vulnerable is cute to me for some reason"
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","strangest","Well, it's more sad than strange. It used to be incredibly rural where I grew up. Just a few houses scattered around, huge fields of grass. Now that's all gone, replaced by tract houses and manicured lawns and a movie theater."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","like_work","I'm a secretary for a local church. I mostly keep track of the social media side of the church. I like it because it's easy, it pays well, and I'm mostly left alone to do my business. Autonomy kicks butt."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","famous","No, I absolutely would not want to be famous. Being famous means the ends of privacy, which I love too much. I would much rather be rich instead of famous."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","how_raised","I was always a very shy person growing up. I feel like I missed out on a lot because I wasn't outgoing enough. I would love to live my teen years over again and not be so terribly emo and shy."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","fire_rescue","I guess I would save my hard drive backup. It contains most of my collected music, videos, and most importantly photos I've taken. It has 20+ years of my personal photography on it and I'd lose my mind if it all burned away."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","mind_body","I'll take the 30 year old's mind, easily. I've seen many people grow old and develop dementia or alzheimer's and it is terrible and frightening and sad beyond measure. I don't have a problem if my body breaks down and I'm stuck in a wheelchair. If I can keep a nice young brain and good memories, i'll take it!"
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","religious","I'm somewhat religious. I believe it provides comfort to me. To know that there is something waiting for me after I die makes me feel less sick to live in this world."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","friend_value","I would say I value honesty above all. If you can't be honest with someone, you can't trust them. If you can't trust them, they can't be a friend."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","last_sing","Sometimes when I'm hanging out with my friends and getting drunk, I'll start singing a song but make it about the situation we are in. Like a very low quality version of Weird Al. I sing to myself every morning when I shower, though mostly it's humming."
"R_0AqV0iyoxN5T8Ln","garden","No, sadly I live in an apartment so no garden for me. I have a few house plants to liven up the place a little, but nothing else. I should probably look into getting one of those little outdoor spice rack things. I could put it on my little patio and grow basil and whatnot."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was that there were too many old people. None of my neighbors were children growing up, so I had to play by myself a lot. Once I moved, I had the chance to make to friends."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","cute_baby","The cutest thing I saw a baby do was try to repeat bad words the mother was saying. Although it shouldn't have been doing that, I was very comical. I cherish that memory to this day."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","religious","I am not a religious person. I consider myself an atheist and have done so since I was 16. I except everyone else's spiritual beliefs, but it is not for me."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","fire_rescue","My laptop would be that item. I do all my work on it and would be lost without it. I also would have no money because I work online."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","friend_value","Loyalty is what I value most in a friendship. If I can't trust you, we can't be friends. Trust can be the strongest glue in a relationship."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","garden","I do not have my vegetation growing. I used to be very much into growing plants, but now I can't find the time. Do you have any?"
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","like_work","I do data entry for work. It is better than most other jobs I have had. I just sit and type all day, it is pretty easy."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","how_raised","I would want to be raised in a more accepting family. My family is a bit homophobic, and I am not like that at all. Slowly, over time though, they are becoming more accepting."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","last_sing","I last sang to myself last night in the shower. I was blasting my speakers while washing my hair. It was a fun and refreshing time."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","famous","I would love to be famous. I would like to be internet famous and just post my thoughts all day and watch people respond. I would also love the countless endorsements."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","mind_body","I would want my look/brain to transfer to my old body. I would like to be 90 and living life. This, I'm sure is most people goals."
"R_0Cfn5ChBkLaF2SZ","why_studies","I do these online studies because, in all honesty, they pay me. I like to do work on Mturk, and it can be a lucrative job. Its all about answering questions carefully and honestly."
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","last_sing","I sang to myself earlier today in the car while driving to the supermarket. I love to sing along to my favorite songs, especially old hits from the '80s. I also love to sing in the shower when I am home alone. However, I have a terrible voice, so I don't put anyone else through having to listen to me sing. I honestly can't remember the last time I sang to someone else, and I feel sorry for anyone who has had to listen to my rendition of Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love of All"". "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","how_raised","That is a tough question, because really I think my parents did quite a good job at raising me. I suppose if I could change anything about the way I was raised, I would ask my parents to not work quite so hard to save up so much money for my college they way they did. I really appreciate it, of course, but in retrospect I think they could have had some more fun when they were younger and I could have gone to a less expensive, in-state state university and received just as good an education that way. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","famous","I would most definitely not want to be famous, in any way. I would much rather blend in with the crowd and not be noticed by random people I don't know. If I were to be famous for anything, I would at least want to famous for some intelligent idea I had or maybe for doing something good for the world, like finding a cure to a terrible disease. But I would not want people on the street to be able to recognize me and cause me grief. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","friend_value","I value most the honesty and trust that comes with a true friendship. That is, being able to share anything and everything that might be bothering you in any way, and not worrying about being judged about it or otherwise looked down upon because of it. I value being able to be open and honest and discuss your innermost thoughts or crazy ideas and not worrying that your friend will think you are weird or a bother. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","why_studies","I do these online studies because it's a fun way to pass the time and even make a few dollars while I'm at it. Sometimes I have a little time where I can't get too much done anyway, like when I'm waiting for my son to come home, or I have to go somewhere soon but I have a little extra time, so it's nice to be able to do these online studies instead of otherwise wasting time on the internet. There is a lot of variation in these studies which makes it fun. For example, right now I am doing a study where you have to answer a variety of questions in full sentences, as if you're having a friendly conservation with a friend. I've never done a study like that before, so it's a fun new thing to try."
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","fire_rescue","It's funny you ask this, because my husband and I ponder this question all the time, just what exactly would we save if we had to run out in a hurry? If I could only save exactly one item, I'd have to go with my main computer that has all of my important files on it -- or at least one of my backup drives, except those are kept in a fireproof box so hopefully they would survive the fire. Realistically though, if my house were on fire I wouldn't waste the time to try to disconnect my desktop computer to save it. I would probably just try to grab my wallet or at least my car keys. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","cute_baby","Well, I might be just a little biased here, but I would say my son did about the cutest thing I've ever seen a baby do when he was a little tyke, and that was to roll a ride-on car around the house by walking behind it as though it were a walker. What I mean is that he would walk behind the car, instead of sitting in it, and he would push it through the house from the back, and I was amazed at how well he could steer it like that just by pushing it. He never even ran into walls with it, which was pretty amazing. I always smile when I think back on him doing that, and it makes me hope that he will be a good driver when he learns to drive in a few years!"
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","strangest","I guess the strangest thing about where I grew up that I can think of is the fact that my house was part of a residential neighborhood, but on a surprisingly busy road. It should have been a quiet, local street, but it happened to serve as a shortcut from one busy road to a major highway, so a lot of commuters used this street and drove way too fast. Because of this, I remember my mom severely scolding me for not looking both ways before crossing the street on my bicycle when I was a kid. Of course it didn't seem strange to me at the time, but when I became an adult and drove back to see the old house, it struck me as an odd neighborhood because of that road being used a shortcut by so many drivers. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","like_work","Right at the moment I'm mostly a stay-at-home mom, and I love it. I do some part-time work, and sometimes some online studies, but mostly I am taking care of my family right now. I enjoy what I do because I feel it's important for kids to have someone there for them even after they start school. Neither my family nor my husband's family lives close by, so it just seemed to make more sense to us for me to devote most of my time to raising the family than working outside the home. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","mind_body","That's a tough choice, but I think I would have to say I'd rather retain the mind of a 30-year-old rather than the body. I mean, ideally I'd really like to retain both, but having a young body wouldn't do me much good if my mind deteriorates. However, if my body deteriorates, at least I would be able to rely on my mind and retain my memories, abilities, and knowledge. Plus, I'd look pretty silly being 80 years old and dancing around like a 30-year-old! "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","garden","No, I really don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden because I live in a condo building. Well, it's really a townhouse, and I could actually have a garden here if I wanted to, but honestly I'm just too lazy for gardening. A lot of the older people who live here do plant gardens and have some beautiful plants, but I've really never liked gardening. There are trees here, of course, but I don't think we have any fruit trees in the area. "
"R_0oZuKVylWIzZlWF","religious","No, I'm not a religious person. I wasn't brought up believing in any particular religion, so being religious just doesn't really make sense to me. I do believe it's important to live an honest, moral life, though, and I do see how the various religious texts such as the Bible can help with that, but I interpret the stories of the Bible as written by people to explain their world and help them live moral lives, rather than as the ""word of God"". I am a bit spiritual in that I do believe there is some greater meaning or purpose to the universe than what we can understand, but I don't think we have made any progress to understanding what that is as of yet. "
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","strangest","There is nothing strange about that place. It is a lovely place where people care about each other. Neighbors are like family members who are always there for you. "
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30-year-old because physical appearance has always been very important to me. I always make sure to take care of myself so that I don't look my age. Keeping a mind of a 90-year-old would be a benefit because I will be wiser."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","friend_value","I value trust the most. I need to trust the person I am sharing almost everything with. Trust gives comfort in relationships."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","famous","Yes, I would like to be famous. I would like to be known for my hard work. I work really hard and excel in almost everything that I do."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","why_studies","I do online surveys to make some extra money. It is also a good source of gaining knowledge. I also feel as I am helping and contributing to a greater cause."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","garden","No, I don't. I do not like planting really. I think it creates a mess. I love having fresh grass though."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was a minute ago because I love singing. It's my passion. I keep checking how good I have gotten at it. The last time I sang to someone else was a few days ago - to my boyfriend."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","fire_rescue","I would save my laptop. It has all my pictures/memories. It has all my documents and work from years that I wouldn't want to be wasted and lost."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","religious","No, I am not a religious person. I dont practice my religion. I do, however, try to do a good thing."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is trying to hold on to something. They think it is so close to them and they can catch it easily but they actually try really hard to do what they want to do with it. Them trying so hard and not giving up is so cute."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","how_raised","It would be making me become more trustful of people. I always have trust issues and I think it makes my life hard. I do not trust anyone; I feel everyone has ulterior motives."
"R_0rDoKt8iE35kPKh","like_work","I work as a customer service agent. I like dealing with people from different backgrounds. It increases my knowledge and gives me a chance to see how diverse this country is."
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","friend_value","I'd say I value honesty over everything else. I don't like when people have other intentions or skirt around things. Just be straight up with me regardless of the situation. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","famous","I would never want to be famous. Famous people spend their lives being ridiculed and scrutinized. There is so much pressure from the media and the public. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","religious","I'm not really religious though I do specify a religion. I feel like there's too much reliance on a religion for people to act sensible. One shouldn't need one to know how to treat others and the earth. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","mind_body","The body for sure. At 30 years old you still have so much to learn and experience. I would want the wisdom of a 90 year old with the body of a 30 year old. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","last_sing","I often will put what I'm doing to words and song randomly. I last sang to my daughters in singing along with their favorite television show. We often sing the songs together. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","why_studies","I mainly do them for the money if I'm being completely honest but I do pick and choose. Sometimes a study will sound kind of interesting so I check it out. I like studies that have interesting subjects. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","fire_rescue","I would probably save my laptop. I use it literally everything and document many things. I have so many lists, photos, etc. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","how_raised","I think I would only change our financial situation. There were times we really struggled. Other than that, I think my mother raised us quite well. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","cute_baby","One time my youngest daughter was crying. My toddler wanted to help console her so she did what she had seen me do. She tried to nurse her sister. I thought it was sweet and adorable. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","like_work","I only work on Mturk right now. I like that I can earn money while caring for my daughters. Before I found out about Mturk we were struggling a lot financially. Now I can help my husband out. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","garden","I don't at the moment but I hope to have one whenever we're able to afford a house. I want to grow herbs and aloe plants. I like to use them in hair care. "
"R_0v6jSmaRUSpWSNr","strangest","The neighbors were very strange to me. No one ever came outside aside from walking to and from their cars. I was used to other neighborhoods where people were much more social so this was a shock. "
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","like_work","I am a research chemist.  I enjoy being able to develop new products on my own and see them go to the commercial market.  I love going into a store and seeing something I worked on on the shelf.  I also enjoy the process of working through what works and what doesn't in order to get to a final product.  I like evaluating many different variations to see which one is the best."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","religious","I am not a religious person, but I do believe in a higher power.  I think that belief in a higher power gives me passion to be more open to abstract ideas and beliefs.  I also enjoy going to church occasionally because places of worship are somewhere that you can let your guard down and really reflect on yourself.  I think that religion can offer people hope and compassion in times of need. "
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","famous","I would not like to be famous because I am a very private person.  I don't feel like I would enjoy all the unnecessarily harsh criticism that famous people face in the world today.  I wouldn't enjoy being in the spotlight because I don't want people analyzing my every move.  I also wouldn't want to have to worry about whether people are following me every day to see what I am doing in my life."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is how flat the landscape is.  I grew up in the Midwest and we really don't have any hills or mountains around us for hundreds of miles.  I never really knew what mountains were until I went on a vacation west when I was a kid."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","why_studies","I do these online studies for several reasons, the first of which is I enjoy helping out people doing research.  I'm a research chemist myself and I really like helping out fellow doctors and scientists study human reactions.  Secondly, I feel like doing these research surveys is a much more productive use of my time as opposed to being on my phone or watching TV.  Thirdly, I find doing these studies intellectually stimulating.  I like the possibly of learning more about myself by the way I respond to these surveys.  "
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","fire_rescue","I would save my old photos.  I can always buy new things, but I cant get pictures back.  I enjoy looking through them every so often because it brings back such good memories.  Although the photos themselves aren't worth much, the memories that they remind me of are priceless.  I would also want to save photos because some of the people that are in them aren't around anymore and I never want to forget what they look like."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a child do is put their favorite blanket over their pet dog.  The child was outside when it was a bit chilly out and said that his face was cold so his dog must be cold since the dog doesn't wear clothes.  The child then put his blanket over the dog because he didn't want his pet to be cold.  It was so cute to see a child think about something other than itself."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old because I have seen how heartbreaking it is when older people start to lose their memory.  I would want to retain my mind because I would feel so frustrated and heartbroken to start forgetting who my family members are when I get older.  I have seen first hand the hurt of loved ones when a relative doesn't remember who their husband, son, niece, etc. is anymore.  I also wouldn't want to forget all the memories I have from my life because the good memories keep me going every day."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","how_raised","If I could change one thing it would have to be being raised as an only child.  I am used to being alone and I think this has caused me difficult in making friends.  Being in social situations is a little taxing for me and I really enjoy having times to myself which isn't conducive to making friends.  I feel like if I had siblings I would find it easier to be outgoing to make friends."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","last_sing","I sang to myself in the car on the way to work this morning.  I love listening to music during my drive and I sing along to keep myself occupied and as a stress relief.  I especially enjoy singing songs that I know very well.  I dont usually sing in front of other people because I am a pretty shy person.  Very rarely will I sing with my boyfriend in the car."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","garden","I have several gardens around my home.  I enjoy changing it up every so often, but currently I have 3 different gardens.  My first garden is in the far back of my yard and is a wildflower garden with zinneias, sunflowers, cosmos, and bachelor buttons.  My front flower beds have several bushes along with warm colored marigolds and snap dragons (which are my favorite).  Finally, I have a vegetable garden on the side of my garage that has strawberries and tomatoes in it.  I really enjoy all of my gardens because it is so interesting to see something like a sunflower go from a tiny seed all the way into a plant that's taller than I am."
"R_0VrnZ54RraGbTBT","friend_value","One of the things I value most in a friendship is honesty.  I value honesty because I want friends that really care about me instead of people that just tell me what I want to hear.  I want my friend to tell me the truth so that I can possibly see things from a different perspective than my own.  By having friends with different opinions I can learn about new viewpoints and hopefully grow as a person."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","last_sing","I sang a popular tune to myself. I heard it on the radio and I liked the melody so I sang it to myself. I last sang happy birthday to my friend."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","friend_value","I value honesty the most. It is the foundation of all relationships, including friendships. It gives the relationship value and structure. It is the most important aspect of a friendship."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","mind_body","I would want enough money so that I can travel around the world and do exciting things. I would use that body to go to many different places and meet new people. I would experience new cultures and try new things."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","famous","I would not like to be famous. It does not give me any happiness. I prefer to be ordinary and subtle. "
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","strangest","My hometown is predominantly white, but the school that I went to was pretty diverse. The proportions of different ethnicities in the school were not representative of the town's population. It made the school more interesting and inclusve."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","fire_rescue","I would take my wallet. It has all of my important information and items. I could take care of things more easily if I have my wallet with me."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","garden","No, I do not have any of those. I do not live in a place that allows tenants to have plants. I wish I could grow some vegetables of my own."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","cute_baby","I saw a child chase a puppy around a park. They were having a lot of fun. I found that to be very cute. It was a pure moment."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","religious","I am not religious. I do not find any religion to be convicing. I cannot bring myself to believe in a god that is all good, omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient while allowing the world to have so much cruelty and suffering."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","why_studies","I do these studies for multiple reasons. I find them interesting and  I learn quite a bit from them. I have free time so I want to spend it doing something worthwhile. I also like the financial incentive of these studies."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","how_raised","I would like to change the place in which I grew up. I wish I could have grown up in a different country. Maybe I could have lived in a different country for different parts of my childhood. I wish I learned about different cultures."
"R_10A6WtGvA1tvTSD","like_work","I am an accountant. I like the ability to work on my own. I like that I do not have to work with others for me to succeed. I like that it requires critical thinking in order to do well."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","religious","Yes. I was raised in the church. I am a protestant and I believe in God, but over time I have somewhat amended my beliefs and I think I am not very interested in organized religion. I believe we all worship the same God and everyone around the world is seeking that through their individualized faith. "
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","garden","Not really. I've never been a good gardener or been a person you could say had a green thumb. When I was younger I wanted to plant a garden and ended up plating this wildflower patch that got out of control! But I love sunflowers. My cousin used to grown watermelons."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","how_raised","I think it would be to be taught a little more about boundaries and how to love yourself first before everyone else. You see both my mom and dad were incredibly generous and loving people and I just grew up knowing you needed to help and encourage and support others. However, as an adult I feel sometimes I have been taken advantage of and I just have too much love to give and need to learn how to preserve myself better."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","last_sing","You know it's funny but I grew up in a family where we would regularly sing to ourselves. My father would sing out, ""I love you"" to me all the time. Yeah it was great. But yeah I think the last time I was singing to myself was when I was working out and listening to David Bowie on Google Play."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","strangest","I grew up in a college town. I grew up in Ann Arbor Michigan and it was filled with hippies and intellectual eccentrics. I suppose the strangest thing were our neighbors. The dad was a bearded professor that left his kid, Matthew, alone all day at like 5 year's old. He would come over to our house. His mother tried to overdose. "
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","cute_baby","I suppose it's when they elicit natural responses to the world around them that only a child can do. Such as responding with a smile or questions that come from a very pure place. It's observing their total, complete faith in humanity that is both mesmerizing and incredibly heartening at the same time. It's truly very inspiring."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","why_studies","Honestly, I do them for the money. Some actually are interesting and you can really learn things, especially when they are put together by academics to investigate trending topics like global warming and environmentalism. I have even transcribed things where I learned a lot. I once did a piece on Obama's administration. It was really interesting."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","like_work","I am the information liaison for open heart patients and their families. I love supporting and helping people. I have over 200 awards for doing it from the hospital I work in."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","famous","You know it's funny but I kind of would. I'm a Gemini so I love the spotlight and communicating. Apart from the obvious perks, I just think it would be great to make an impact on the world like Kate Middleton. But I would love prancing around in beautiful clothes and living life with passion and excitement."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","mind_body","I think I would want a spouse with the same virtues! I would want to travel a lot and I would like an eclectic mix of friends of all ages and backgrounds. Ultimately I would like to be living in Europe."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","friend_value","I value consistency and honesty and a shared perspective. I can't stand being friends with people who don't really hold the same values as I do. Such as a commitment to excellence or an appreciation of art and beauty. Otherwise people just drag you down."
"R_10IpOQE8ZjEg7Bj","fire_rescue","Mm that is a hard question. I suppose I could say family photos or something I wrote. But I think it could also be some physical item of adornment. You see I love beauty and certain things I have collected have incredible memory for me. I think it would be my sterling silver pearl necklace from Tiffany's that my father gave me."
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","last_sing","Oh, I'm a terrible singer! I do still sing along to songs in private though. Just yesterday I was singing along to a Taylor Swift song. I never sing in front of people! I'm too embarrassed! "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","fire_rescue","I don't think there's anything I would save. Besides my loved ones and pets, I don't have too much of an attachment to other items that I own. I would be fine with just replacing them. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","strangest","Strangest thing? I don't really know. I don't consider anything about where I grew up to be strange. I feel like it was more or less your typical neighborhood. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","like_work","I'm actually unemployed right now. I've held a few jobs in the past. I worked as a copy editor for my university's newspaper and more recently, I worked as a data entry clerk. I enjoyed both of those jobs because the work environment was great. The people were friendly and the environment made me feel comfortable. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","friend_value","I definitely value trust. I want to be able to tell my friend private details about my life without having to worry about her telling other people. I also value kindness, loyalty, and dependability. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","why_studies","I do online studies because they help contribute to scientific research. I also enjoy the fact that I can earn money from the studies. The money might not be much, but I am happy with the amount. I also like that I can do them from the comfort of my own home. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","garden","No, I don't. My dad loves gardening though. Every summer he plants seeds and grows a vegetable garden. He has a PhD in agriculture, so he has a bunch of knowledge about growing vegetables. He loves gardening!"
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","cute_baby","I've seen a child pronounce a word incorrectly. It was pretty cute. She pronounced ""spaghetti"" as ""psgetti."" I think there are quite a few kids who make this error, but yeah, I find it to be cute. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","how_raised","I moved a lot as a child. It was difficult because I had to leave behind my friends. I'm also very shy, so it was difficult for me to make new friends. I think I would change the moving around so much. Instead, I would have liked to be settled into a good, safe neighborhood. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","religious","No, I'm not really the most religious person. I mean, I believe in God, but I don't consider myself to be religious. My family is Muslim, so I consider myself to be Muslim as well, but I don't really pray or partake in other religious activities. "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","famous","I don't know if I would. I feel like if I was famous, I would be scrutinized for every little thing that I did. I think it would be cool to be famous in an academic sense though. Like, being written about in textbooks would be cool! "
"R_10oRJayHgYdtBfo","mind_body","Oh, that's a tough one! I can't really decide. I mean, it would be awesome to have either. Having the mind would be great because I could avoid memory problems that occur with old age. Having the body would be great as well though because I would still be able to travel the world and do a lot of exciting things. "
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","fire_rescue","I would save my pictures. I have a lot of pictures of people who have passed. The pictures hold a lot of memories  for me."

Yes, I am a very religious person. I believe in God and pray each day. I often go
to church. I am a Christian."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","cute_baby","I think everything a baby or child does is very cute. I think the cutest thing is when they get excited to see Santa Claus. I love it when they sit on Santa's lap."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","famous","I would like to be famous for being a kind person and helping others. I would also like to be famous for singing beautiful religous songs. I wouldn't want to be a famous actress or athlete.."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","how_raised","I would be more loving to my parents. Looking back, it seems like I was always fighting with them. Now that I am older, I realize they were trying to be good parents. They weren't trying to make me mad."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","last_sing","I don't sing very much. Last time I sang, I was alone in car and sang with the radio. I think the last time I sang to someone was HAppy Birthday, a few months ago."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","mind_body","I think I would prefer the mind of a 30 year old. I like to have intellectual discussions and read alot. I would never want to lose my mind."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","why_studies","I like giving my input to people. I also like the money I earn. It is not a lot of money, but pays for extra things. It is a great job."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","strangest","Nothing was really strange about where I grew up. It was a very normal neighborhood, in a normal town. I loved my town that I grew up in."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","friend_value","I value compassion and loyalty in friendship. I want to have a friend I can tell things too. I also would like to have a good friend I can trust to always be there for me."
"R_10PkcFVr2L5SojO","garden","No, I do not have any plants or a garden. I do not have a green thumb . Plants and trees usually die when I take care of them, unfortunately."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","last_sing","I haven't sang to anyone personally in my life, but I did sing this morning in the shower. Singing in the shower is just something I do from time to time to keep positive. It's a good way to start your day."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","fire_rescue","I would definitely save my smartphone above all else. Having a way to contact love ones in this specific situation is important because of the dangers of the fire spreading. I also rely on my phone to keep in contact with friends and loved ones."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","mind_body","I would like to retain the mind of a 30-year-old. I think it would be better to be sound minded rather than have the body of a 30-year-old. Having the body of a 30-year-old and a non matching mind would be too difficult to control. "
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","how_raised","I would change the location of where I was raised. Growing up in America for the most part has been unfulfilling. I feel that I missed a big part of culture that seems to be missing in this country."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","why_studies","I do these online studies because they are fulfilling. I enjoy contributing to the research. I also just enjoy doing them in my spare time."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","famous","I wouldn't want to be famous. I'm sure the money would be great, but the pressure of being famous would get to me. I think dealing with the paparazzi on a daily basis would be too much."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","religious","I am not a religious person. I never had any reason to believe in a higher power and none of my family was guided in that direction. It doesn't affect me either way so I hold no loyalty to a religion."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","strangest","The strangest thing about this place is that there are no public family owned businesses. Everything around here is corporate and chain stores. It takes away from the sense of community that other places seem to have."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","friend_value","I think I value honesty above all else. Friends should become as a second family to me. Them being honest with me shows me how much they care."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do was not just cute, but admirable. I've seen a child spend their entire evening after school baking cookies for their father. The sentiment of this was entirely adorable."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","garden","I have a small garden in my backyard. It's nothing special, but I do tend to it. At the moment I have carrots growing."
"R_10YpJk5ZuD3QUe9","like_work","I currently work as a computer technician. The best thing about my job is that I get to work on computers and IT hardware all day. It's a dream job."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","fire_rescue","I would run for my external hard drive in a heartbeat. While the pictures and documents on there are critically important, my most prized possession is my digital music collection. Culled from thousands of CDs I've owned or borrowed over the last 20 years, I've collected and curated the files for years - adding artwork, labeling things accurately, adding metadata. I have tons of rare albums, CD singles, rare compilations and other CDs ripped at perfect audio quality, so any song I could ever ask for is right at my fingertips. I love a lot of things I own, but in a fire it would be my first thought."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","strangest","There was very little strange about where I grew up; it was just a small suburb to the northeast of Philadelphia. It was - and is, like many suburbs - mainly houses, strip malls and community buildings including the school, library, post office and so on. However, my little hometown did actually land in the national news recently. It turned out that - for years - a man had kept 12 underage girls in his home, convincing them he was a prophet of God! He was arrested last year and the girls were removed from the house just a few streets away from my childhood home."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","mind_body","I would definitely choose to keep my mind! I doubt I'd even enjoy the physical pleasures of youth if I didn't have the mind to fully process and appreciate them. My favorite relatives have been the ones who have stayed sharp at 80 and 90 years old; I personally dread having my mind or memory fade much more than I worry about my body, despite the copious amounts of grey hair I'm already sporting today at 35!"
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","cute_baby","My cousin has a daughter, Maggie, who just turned ten this year. Even though I'm not her Uncle, my cousins and I grew up as close as siblings, and her daughter calls me ""Uncle-Cousin Nick"". A few years ago at Christmas, she asked my boyfriend and I why we weren't married, and we explained that it just wasn't something we were interested in, but that if the moment was ever right we might do it. Later that evening, as everyone was relaxing after dinner, Maggie came into the room and told 20+ assembled family and friends that they had to be very quiet. She actually reached up and dimmed the lights as she said ""there's something very special that Uncle-Cousin Nick wants to ask Craig."" She was trying to guilt me into proposing on the spot!"
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","religious","I am not a religious person at all, despite having spent a lot of time investigating whether I could or should be. I grew up in a Catholic household, but I always found church boring and stifling. Despite my mother's best efforts, I never believed any of it was more than a very interesting story. It was only by chance that I ended up at a Catholic college, where many of my friends were very active Protestant Christians. I tried joining them for church and even went to a religious retreat for a weekend, but while I enjoyed spending time with my friends, the religious side of it still wouldn't stick, so I've pretty much stayed away since then."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","famous","I have never wanted to be famous at all. I can't imagine lacking the basic privacy to go shopping or walk the city streets without being harassed by strangers. I already have so little time to do the things I want - read all the books, see all the movies, play all the games - that it's terrifying to think about giving up what precious time I have just to keep up with the trappings and obligations of fame."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","how_raised","My parents and brother were very disinterested in sports. In fact, while we were involved in lots of activities, I was never enrolled in soccer, basketball, baseball or any other sports as a kid. My parents both thought that sports were a waste of time, and my brother was a big brain with very little in the way of physical coordination. I grew up thinking sports were for ""dumb jocks"" and it wasn't until I got to college that I realized how much I loved basketball. I play in an adult league now, but I wonder how much fun it would have been to play truly competitive and meaningful games for my high school."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","like_work","I work at a Publishing company here in the city. Unfortunately we don't publish anything fun - mostly textbooks and medical journals, and our primary customers are researchers and students. Personally, I work in our technology department, so I don't have a science background at all. I help make sure all of the written content in our print books is converted into digital formats for online viewing and tablet versions. I like the problem-solving aspects involved with converting a book with a set layout into something that's more adaptable on the web!"
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","last_sing","I just sang to myself today on the train! I was headed into the city to run some errands, and my train car was empty for most of the ride. I was listening to a new album I like on my headphones and I sang along - probably too loudly - as I rode the train! My boyfriend and I sing all the time around the house. I am NOT a good singer, but I sang to him last night (a parody version of Everybody Hurts by REM - an inside joke that we share)."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is having someone who will be there for me when I need them. My best friend and I are very close, and while most of our conversations are very light and fun, he's always been there when I'm upset or scared about something, and he's let me vent to him or ask advice. I try to do the same for him. Even though we're adults, sometimes the world can get to be too much and we need someone to take care of us; having a friend to jump in and take the reins every once in a while is very valuable."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","why_studies","I was looking for a very flexible part-time job, but wasn't really cut out for anything. My boyfriend got a job doing bike deliveries at night, but I don't ride a bike and wasn't suited to it. I started doing studies out of curiosity, but was surprised when the money really started to add up to something useful! I gravitated specifically toward online studies and surveys like this one instead of batch work. These studies are much more interesting, less tedious, and it usually feels good to know I've contributed something valuable to science or society."
"R_11cJ3FubZaBqiJp","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants or a garden! I always wanted to grow things when I was a kid and had a lawn; I used to find seeds in nature and try planting them in my parents' yard, but nothing ever grew. Finally we got tiny baby trees for Earth Day at school, and I brought mine home and planted it in the same spot I always buried things. It actually grew for a while until it was about a foot tall, but it didn't survive the winter snow. Now I live in a city in an apartment building, so I haven't had a second chance to see if my thumb has gotten any greener!"
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","like_work","I'm a video editor for a mid-sized production studio. There are too many enjoyable aspects to list but I would say first that I like telling stories with sound and pictures. The next thing I like best about it is the technology--it has changed a lot since I started my career over ten years ago and I enjoy keeping up with the latest innovations and using each one to the advantage of whatever project I am working on."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","fire_rescue","Probably my Macbook pro. It contains a lot of photos and projects that I wouldn't want to be without. It also contains a lot of expensive software that I would not want to have to replace."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","cute_baby","My five-year-old niece is best friends with the family's golden retriever. They are inseparable and do a lot of cute things together but so far, the cutest thing I've seen is when Maddie asked the dog if she wanted to watch something on TV together. Maddie picked out a show about cats and I swear the two of them stared at the show for 20 minutes, completely engrossed in it."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","famous","I would not want to be famous at all. I'm a pretty self-conscious person and I could not imagine getting a ton of attention every time I left the house. If I had to be famous, I would want to be famous for doing something good or heroic."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","how_raised","I would definitely want a more stable home life. My parents divorced when I was very young and I had to spend half my childhood going back and forth between the two. I also had to deal with several step-parents and more divorce on that level."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","strangest","I grew up in a town in Southern California with a large wild peacock population. They are a kind of funny, odd type of bird and some might think it's strange to see them ambling down the street in a big group, blocking traffic and basically acting like the own place. Another strange aspect about them is they are very noisy and they sound off all day and all night. The main call of the male basically sounds like a woman screaming for help and can be unnerving to people who haven't heard it before."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","last_sing","First of all, I would never sing to someone else as I have a horrible singing tune. The last time I sang to myself, I hardly realized it but it was while I was eating too much of this pasta made. I realized after a few bites that I was sort of singing ""one more bite"" to the tune of some 80s song called ""One More Night."""
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","garden","I do have a garden but no fruit trees. Anything I have planted in the ground doesn't do very well (I blame the high content of clay in my soil) but I do have a lot of potted plants and shrubs. I would like to have a lemon tree but it attracts too many rodents where live."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","friend_value","I most value a friendship that means I can tell someone anything, without worrying about being judged negatively. Friendship means having someone to listen to your problems, instead of dealing with them alone. I also like helping friends with their problems."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","religious","I'm not a religious person. I just wasn't raised with religion and I guess I never ""caught the bug."" I can see the value of it and I have religious friends but personally, it's just not something that interests me. I just try to treat others as I would like to be treated and I try to be unselfish and kind."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","mind_body","I would choose the mind. I think I am in good shape and will always work to stay in good physical shape. But I think having a young body would be pointless if I were suffering dementia or other age-related brain issues."
"R_11jgQ8RfxYITptx","why_studies","I find them very interesting. Having done several at this point, I also find that answering a lot of questions about myself, makes me more aware of myself and my actions. I also do them for a little bit of extra money."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","strangest","The city in which I grew up was ordinary in many ways. One thing that stood out, however, was that you could see a lot of trains from where our house was. I would sit in the window for hours just to look at the trains passing by. We also had a lot of doves, I suppose that could be strange too, perhaps even stranger than the trains. The doves were pretty aggressive, maybe because they had been fed by humans so often. Outside of that, the city was quite normal."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","like_work","Right now I am not working. I used to work as a customer service representative at a telecommunication company for a while. I had to quit because the job became to taxing on my nerves. I began to wake up in the morning with a dread, like going to work was the worst thing I could do. I would come home almost crying, because customers were being rude to me. I did like the friends I made there though, and the pay itself wasn't all that bad."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","fire_rescue","If I had to pick only one item, I would probably take my laptop computer with me. I keep many important files, and I use it to keep in touch with family members who live far away. I also happen to do some work using my laptop, so being without it would be difficult. It is hard to choose just one item, but that's most likely the one I would take."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","cute_baby","I don't think I could tell you. I seem to have watched a few videos on America's Funniest Home Videos, but nothing sticks. I think it's funny when a baby or a child tries to say something, but flubs the words, or when they make a mess while eating. I wouldn't say that's cute, though. I can't really think of anything cute, only funny videos come to mind."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","famous","I would not like to be famous. Personally, I don't think I could handle being in the public light. Being famous sounds stressful, and I don't like being stressed, or having to look over my should all the time. I feel more comfortable just being myself. I could be famous among my friends and family, but I feel that is as far as I would go."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","friend_value","A good friend is someone who you can trust. A friendship is to be taken lightly, it should be valued. I think a good friend ought to be there for you when you need it the most. A good friend is someone who will offer you their shoulder to cry on, and someone who will lend you their ear. A friend knows when to joke, and when to be serious."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","last_sing","The last time I sing to myself and others was when my wife and I were playing a video game together with a few of her friends. I believe I sang the song ""Take on Me"" by A-ha. It was an interesting experience, since I don't usually sing. I felt a bit embarrassed to be honest. I don't like putting myself out there, so doing something like I did then was difficult for me."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","mind_body","If I had to make the choice, while being guaranteed to live until the age of 90, I would choose the mind. I have seen many smart people lose their ability to speak and articulate themselves well. I have heard about Alzheimer's and how devastating its effects can be. I want to be able to enjoy a good book, solve a crossword puzzle or play a challenging video game. The mind is such a wonderful thing, and I hate seeing it go to waste."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","religious","I have never considered myself a religious person. I do not believe in a higher power, or that there is something greater than ourselves out there. I guess I believe what I believe due to the way I was raised by my parents. They never took me to any religious service. Perhaps this is because they themselves never went to church when they were young. You could say not being religious is a family thing."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","how_raised","That is a difficult question. I would say my parents raised me well. They taught me manners and common decency. If I had to choose, I would say my parents should have encouraged me to stay on and play sports as a child. I feel that this would have made me better adjusted in social situations."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","why_studies","Much of it because they pay me well. Doing these online studies allows me to purchase things I otherwise could not afford, or it means I can pay a bill a little early. I also like helping researchers. I feel like I am advancing science, even if only a little, by performing these studies. In the end, both the researchers and and I benefit from these studies."
"R_125X4JYPsLcCDom","garden","I don't currently have any of those. Before I moved out, while still living with my parents, we tried to plant a vegetable garden. I planted carrots and spinach, and carefully watered it every day, but nothing really grew. At that point, I thought gardening wasn't for me, and I haven't tried it again since. It is more difficult now since I live in an apartment, but perhaps I'd try it again later."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","famous","If I was famous, I would like to be an author.   I would have the respect of a famous person without being as readily recognizable.  This would still have the freedom of a private life.   "
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","how_raised","I had attention deficit disorder as a kid.   My parents particularly my mother would hear rules or trends form a person at our church and change rules every few months.   This mean being relaxed and lenient for three month and then overly strict for a few, than going back.  A child with ADHD need consistent rules and not having this cause a lot of issues."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","friend_value","Friendship needs to have loyalty.   There are going to be good times and bad times, high point and low points.  Over the last few years I have had abotu 15-20 friedns,   Three years ago there was a lot of drama and I was made to look bad within that group leading to a rough time.   Although things a reconciled only three of those friends stuck with me that whole time.  There is a huge difference between a true friend and an acquaintance that you happen to see often."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","garden","I do not.  I am currently renting so that there is no place for me to do that.   Someday down the road, I would like to have property where I could grow my own food."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","like_work","I did customer service at a telecommunications job last and am looking for jobs.  Although there is stress there are positives.   It is a job where you really can make a difference in someone else's day."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","fire_rescue","This would be a tough choice.  I would save a box with some very old photos and family heirlooms.    Everything else is replaceable but this is not.  "
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","why_studies","I had always done mturk for extra money.  Now that I am between jobs, it is my source of income.    The surveys are interest because it exposes you to different viewpoints and walks in life."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","last_sing","I last sung to myself this morning when taking a shower.  I last sang to someone a week ago, with a couple friends we were watching a football game and I made an impromptu song about a bad football team."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","cute_baby","A year ago my mother was feeling sick.  I was visiting my parents and my nephews and niece came by, they came up with an entire skit and play to make her feel better.  It was very cute to see."
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","strangest","Nothing really stands out on this.   All I can think of is that the next door neighbors was a rental house.. Over a five years period there are aboit five or six people who had veru odd quirks.  There very plenty of funny and interesting sotroes about each of them"
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","religious","Yes, I am.  I believe that we are saved by grace through the sacrifice of God's son Jesus Christ.    I follow the Christian faith.  Although I am disillusioned by American churches, I hold fast to this belief.  "
"R_12byMnLXoKnMWXz","mind_body","I would want to the body of a 30 year old.   Having the freedom of retirement with no physical limitation would be great.   Having the mind of a 30 year hold would mean less wisdom."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","famous","I'd really rather not be too famous but I'd like to be a well known writer and be able to make a good solid living from doing just that. I'd love to write full time and share my stories and churn out all those ideas that pop into my head and let it be enough to provide me with the type of living that I don't have to worry over money at all."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","religious","No.  I don't believe in organized religion because I feel it's been corrupted by man. I think after all the times the bible has been translated and transcribed that there is no way of knowing how much of the content has been changed. Also, religion now feels more like sustaining itself rather than teaching people to live a better life or be a better person. These days, I feel that most people are able to decide how best to pray or talk to God and it should be a much more personal connection."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","mind_body","I'd guess that would depend on if it was my 30-year-old body or if I got to pick someone else's 30-year-old body. Seriously though, I think I'd take the mind. While it might be frustrating to have physical limitations there is so much more I can do with my mind and I'd want to be able to remember the important things and the important people in my life. As the old saying goes, a mind is a terrible thing to waste so I'd guess I'd pick the mind."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","how_raised","Overall, I wouldn't really want to change much about how I was raised because I think that I was taught to be independent, open minded and to use my brain and think for myself. If I had to choose something I'd guess I'd say I wish I was more adventurous. Sometimes I think I think too much and I should be more brave to just dare a few things."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","strangest","By today's standards the strangest thing was that we were allowed to run around outside and all over the neighborhood without fear or worry. My parents didn't always know exactly where I was because I could just get on my bike and ride around the block or over to a friend's house. Today, no one would do that because you can't trust people. I'd have to say that is the strangest thing because you can't imagine letting a kid have that much freedom these days."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","last_sing","I'm a terrible singer so I'd try not to sing to anyone else, but I did sing along while listening to music yesterday. While working or reading I often have music playing and I can find myself singing along sometimes without even realizing it. There are also times when certain songs are stuck in my head and I'll be singing those to myself over and over."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","friend_value","I'd have to say honesty and flexibility. I want my friends to be people that I can trust and will tell me the truth, but I also want them to be open minded and able to go with the flow sometimes. That is what can lead to the strongest friendships and let you have the most fun."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","cute_baby","There is a few different videos that I've seen around the internet about a set of twins and their conversations with one another in some sort of baby gibberish. I love watching the one specifically when they're in a kitchen and each have a sock on and one twin is clearly gesturing and commenting on the other twin as if saying you're wearing my sock. While it's all in a gibberish I don't understand it seems as if they know what they're talking about and I think it's the cutest, funniest and coolest thing I've seen a baby do."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","why_studies","One for the money, two for the fun and three to get ready! No, just kidding. I do them to help get paid of course, but there are a lot of them that are really fun and interesting. I'm often fascinated by how answers to some questions can say so much about me or people in general and I think that is worth taking the time to do. I also find myself learning things about myself and they can make me take a look at my thoughts and feelings on topics I might not otherwise have spent much time thinking about at all."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","garden","Yes, yes and yes. We plant a small garden each year with things like tomatoes, squash, peppers, cucumbers and things like that. We also have a few plants like ferns and flowering plants such as violets to spruce up the house. In the backyard we have all sorts of fruit trees because we all love fruit. We have lemons, limes, oranges, pomegranates and we're even thinking of getting a peach or perhaps apricot."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","fire_rescue","That's a tough one to answer as there are a number of personal or family items that I'd want to save but I think I'd safe a scrapbook that my mom made for me when I was a young girl. It has all my accomplishments from essays that won contests, school photos, report cards and other awards that I won at school. It also has clips of my first news stories and things like that. There are also some family photos of important gatherings. I'd save that because it's something of my mom and has a little bit of every part of my life and family in it."
"R_12DS2KpB5haZiIo","like_work","I work from home and do a combination of things. I'm basically self employed and I do online task work on platforms like Mturk and Deamo. I also write and self publish my own books and sometimes do some editing. I love the work because it's very flexible and I get to work at my own pace and feel I have some control over what I choose to do."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","strangest","I think the strangest thing is the house I grew up in. I think it was haunted. There were tons of times that toilet paper would be strewn across the floor of the bathroom when nobody was around. There were all sorts of noises and sometimes doors would come open by themselves. I was scared all the time."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","last_sing","I sing in the shower every day. So it was this morning that I sang to myself. I would sing to my youngest daughter also. She loved to hear songs before she would go to sleep. It's been about 4 years since I sang to her."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","garden","No. I don't really have good land for fruit trees or a garden. I probably wouldn't tend to them very good if I did have them. It's too much work to keep up with a garden. It would be cool to have an apple tree though."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","religious","Yes. I am a religious person but sometimes I don't do very well at living life like one. I am religious because it is nice to believe in God and what the afterlife could be like. I think it's all just about trying to be a better person though."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","friend_value","I value that I can be open and honest. I don't feel like I am being judged or have to hide who I really am. I can really trust a true friend and that means a lot to me."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","fire_rescue","I am saving my computer. I put a lot of money into it and I won't leave without it. I know it can be replaced but I don't care. Some people would go for pictures but I have all of mine digitally stored so I don't care about that."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","cute_baby","That would have to be my youngest daughter. She dove headfirst into her birthday cake when she was just 1 year old. I laughed so hard I was crying. She came up out of the cake and looked like a chocolate monster. Her face was covered in chocolate and icing. She was still eating that cake though."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","like_work","I repair tires at a tire plant. I like the repetitiveness of the work. I like that it provides me a steady paycheck so I don't have to think about money too much. Nobody bothers me when I'm working my shift so I like that. I can listen to music and do my work."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","mind_body","I definitely would want the body of a 30 year old. I think getting old really sucks when you can't hardly move around. I'd like to be able to do all the activities that I like until the day I die. I wouldn't have all that wrinkly skin either."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","how_raised","I think I would have liked less physical punishment. That was the way it was back in my day though. I would do something bad and I would get a whipping with my dad's belt. I think that is the only real problem I had about being raised."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","famous","No I would not like to be famous. You know me. I like to blend into the crowd and not stick out like a sore thumb. Being famous puts too much pressure on a person. You don't get to live life the way you want sometimes."
"R_12hGD0HCR82FUDU","why_studies","I just do it to make some money for video games or to go bowling. It's just some side money that I can spend on things that I like. Money is kinda tight from my paycheck after bills so I could use the money from the studies."
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","cute_baby","I have never seen anything cute. I do not like kids. There is nothing good about them"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","famous","Yes, I want money. Wouldn't you want money? You are stupid for asking this question"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","strangest","It is the deep south. There are lots of strange things. I mean look at the news"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","fire_rescue","I would grab my computer. It has too many things on it I need. I would be lost without it"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","last_sing","I never sing to myself. I never sing to someone else. I do not sing"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","how_raised","I would change everything. It was bad. I will not go into it"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","why_studies","I do these to learn things. I want a better life. That is all I would say"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","mind_body","I would just work. I would make more money. I would also travel"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","friend_value","I value having people care for me. It helps having them. It makes life go by"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","garden","No I do not. I dont want them. Thats it"
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","religious","No I am not. I don't care for religion. Anyone who does is an idiot."
"R_12imr1dhbZKx5sc","like_work","I do this for work. I also do internet marketing. Neither of them I really like"
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","why_studies","I get this question quite a bit actually!  I like to help out the science community, but to be honest, it's not about altruism.  Helping is nice, but the money is why I do it.  It's paid for almost all my Christmas shopping this year, and previous years, I'm able to save a lot more money when I treat these online studies as supplemental income."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","fire_rescue","It would be my computer.  I don't hold much sentiment in items, and my computer cost me around 1,000 dollars.  I do a lot of work on it on the side, so it'd be losing a large financial lifeline too."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","garden","I have a garden in my backyard.  I'd love to have trees, but I don't think I have the patience for them.  But, as someone who cooks a lot, I use a lot of herbs.  There isn't anything better than fresh herbs in food, and they don't get much fresher than when you grow them yourself!"
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","famous","I don't think I'd like to be famous, honestly.  I'd like the perks that come with being famous, which means being rich.  But, seeing when a celebrity goes out and there are just dozens of paparazzi lurking outside their house, that would annoy me.  I enjoy my privacy, and I feel like being famous would take a large amount of that away from me."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","last_sing","I sing every night in the shower.  Not well, mind you, but I just love to sing random songs to myself.  The last time I sang to someone else, was when we were on the drive to put my dog down.  It helped me grieve a bit, and I thought it demonstrated my love for him.  "
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","how_raised","I think I'd like to be disciplined a bit more.  I feel like it took me a long time in life to develop a work ethic that is respectable.  When I was a kid, I shirked off a lot of my duties, I didn't do a lot of my school work, and my parents weren't hard on me."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","like_work","I work over at the restaurant in town.  I'm a chef over there, and pretty much whatever they need me to do.  I love cooking for other people, so it's nice to be able to do it professionally."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","strangest","I think it has to be that the Iceman (the famous mafia killer that HBO did a documentary on) lived two blocks away from me.  It's a rather quiet sleepy down, we all gathered in the park to play kickball and such when I was a kid.  It's kind of strange thinking that a person who has murdered so many people, and became famous for it lived just a block away from that park."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","mind_body","I would choose mind.  The body, of course, would be nice too....but between Dementia, general fogginess and all that...I wouldn't want that happening to me.  You can always work and improve your body, but once the mind starts going, you wouldn't be able to repair that. "
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","cute_baby","The cutest thing is when my friend's kid was obsessed with the word ""no.""  They would toy with him, ask him if he wanted a cookie, and he would always say ""NO!"" while reaching his hand out.  So they'd take it away for a few seconds, and ask him again.  No matter how many times they asked him, he always would say no while reaching for the cookie.  They eventually gave in, but it was always funny to me."
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","friend_value","Honesty is the most important thing to me in a friendship.  Everything else can be worked on, but once you start lying to your friend, you aren't a friend anymore.  Friends should be able to tell each other anything without judgment or taking anything too harsh.  If you can't trust each other, why even bother?"
"R_1C4nPUbMVdOhmpc","religious","I am not a religious person.  I've never much believed in all that dogma, even as a child and my parents never forced it on me.  I think things might be a bit different had they made me go to church and such, but they never did.  I don't dislike religion, I just don't put any stock in it."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","how_raised","I would definitely change a couple of things, first off I would make sure to be more listened to as a child. When I was younger it was the belief of my parents that a child should be seen nor heard for the most part, and it was always a bit annoying. Especially when I would get into an argument with one of my brothers and suddenly everyone would be paying attention. There's really not much else I would change though, as it was a decent upbringing."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","friend_value","I would want to say closeness, or things most in common but that isn't necessarily true to me. Someone who is understanding is probably the most important thing, a person who can empathize with me no matter what. That sort of thing that only the closest of friends have for one another."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","fire_rescue","I would probably have to think about it for a moment, but of course a moment is all I would have. Once I made my way back into the fire, I would probably have to say that I would take my favorite coat as it has my wallet and most of my money inside of it. Then I could most likely use that to buy all of the things that I've lost in the first to begin with, as most of the sentimental stuff is all strewn about and would take a while to find."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","cute_baby","I wouldn't say I've ever seen a baby do anything abnormally cute because I don't particularly pay attention to much to them. Although there was one time whenever I was with my brother and my newly born niece was standing there attempting to walk. She continuously would fall over again and again, and to me that was kind of cute, the perseverance of it all."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","garden","I actually do not have many green things outside of my home, although I do own a rather spunky potted plant. There's only one tree in the entirety of my yard and it has been there for many years, during the winter its barren and kind of cool looking, so I've always kept it around. A few years ago I did attempt to have a garden, however, but that didn't work out for me too much as I'm not the best caretaker in the world."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","like_work","I don't work at the moment, but the last time I worked it was mowing lawns and primming up bushes. It was a decent paying job, I would get paid hourly and everyone was extremely hospitable to me. At one point, during a particularly warm day, the person invited me into their home so that I could relax for a few moments and that was a nice memory."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","religious","I am a bit religious, yes. It's my belief that every person needs to have that thing which they believe in, something that makes them feel excited to live and ready to take on the next day. There's a lot of different types of belief out there, from the belief that one is meant to be on this earth all the way to the humble types who think there are aliens waiting out there somewhere; everyone has their own special God and mine just so happens to be the tried and true Catholic version of God, it helps me feel better and that's one of the most important things in life."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","mind_body","Mind, definitely. While it would be nice to not have to deal with the aches and pains of being old, a 30-year-old isn't going to be all that spry either, but the mind of a 30-year-old is the perfect age to take from. Just old enough to be able to know most about the world, and young enough that its still extremely well oiled and working as perfectly as ever."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","why_studies","Well, one day I decided that I needed a bit of cash and so signed up for mechanical turk so that I could make some extra dough. When I first started I was confused a bit, but eventually, once I got the hang of it, I realized that real money was to be made. So, mostly, that's why I was driven to do this, for the cash aspect mainly, admittedly enough."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","famous","No, I wouldn't like to be famous at all. There's something about the spotlight that makes me extremely wary of it, but maybe it wouldn't be too bad to be famous in a sort of online kind of way where no one will be able to fully know who I am. It's my belief that the more fame you have, the harder anonymity and just living life in general is."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","last_sing","I don't sing, mostly. There have been a few incidents of hyperactivity where I would sing in the shower. The last time I can think of something like that was probably a couple of months ago if not a year or more."
"R_1CDQykMQMu4TTNV","strangest","Strange? I'm not sure what you mean by strange? There's a weird house a few blocks down where there were spooky stories of, but for the most part where I grew up was a pretty quiet and conservative area. Not much in the way of anything happened here, and that's the way most people enjoyed it."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","fire_rescue","That's a tough one! I'd say it would be family photos.  If I could only save one it would be the large marriage photo that hangs in the hall.  It was taken on our wedding day."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","mind_body","Definitely the healthy mind. I worked with early onset dementia patients. It was so sad to see them deteriorate."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","last_sing","I sing out loud frequently. Sometimes I sing to my wife when we're driving. Usually along with a song on the radio but sometimes alone."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","religious","Definitely. I believe the foundation of all knowledge is a fear of God. I can't accept a universe which is random."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","strangest","The dirt was clay. I mean clay clay. Nearly play dough consistency. In fact, there was a large brick maker up the road."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","like_work","I do support, facilitation.  I love working with people. I like seeing projects come to fruition."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","friend_value","I'd have to say trust.  Nobody is perfect. Sometimes even your best friend can get on your nerves.  But if you can trust your friends then that is really valuable."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","famous","Not really. I like to work quietly and I value my privacy.  I'd like to be known as someone who was helpful."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","cute_baby","At age 4 my oldest son used to go up to his grandmothers and hold out his hand.  When they took his hand he would ask them to walk with him.  He would open the door for them and lead them around the pathways in the yard."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","why_studies","I heard abut mturk years ago from a friend.  Eventually I took a look and signed up. Many of the studies are fun.  It is interesting to see how the researchers put together their study. I often ponder the questions and get insights into myself."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","how_raised","I wouldn't change anything because my experiences have made me who I am.  If I am forced to change something, I would have liked to have lived closer to my Grandmothers.  One lived hours away and the other lived across the country. I would like to have seen them more often."
"R_1CIPbATNNMpnuB7","garden","I am doing more indoor gardening these days.  I have several house plants. I plan to start several varieties of coleus this coming spring to plant in containers. i hope they survive and can be brought back  indoors in the fall."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","how_raised","I would want my parents to have encouraged/forced me to participate in some form of sport. It wasn't a big deal in our house, and I grew up without the habit of exercise. That was something I had to learn for myself in my 20s."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","friend_value","Ah, this is an interesting question. I really value honesty and forthrightness. I think of myself as fairly friendly, but I prefer a smaller number of high quality friends than a large number of friendly acquaintances. So when I think of my small group of friends, I think honesty with each other is a big deal."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","garden","Our garden is a mess right now. During the drought, we cut down the watering to the point that the lawn and many plants died. What's left is some citrus trees, a grape vine, rhubarb, and some blueberries. I'm hoping the strawberries come back next year. In the summer we have a vegetable garden as well."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","like_work","I do freelance work - writing articles and such. Similar to what I said about doing online research surveys, I like to be able to be available for my child after school every day."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","religious","Not particularly. I was brought up as a Baha'i, but I don't really feel that I could consider myself practicing. Baha'is don't have a clergy or houses of worship, so growing up what we'd do is go to Sunday school. I think after I ""graduated"" from that I didn't feel the need to share in religious conversations with people. I'm comfortable in my own beliefs and I find my communities in other ways."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","strangest","I grew up in a 70's/80's town in southern California. Stars and celebrities tended to buy homes in my town to avoid the paparazzi and have a nice place to relax. So growing up you'd go to school with someone'd kid, or make milkshakes for some movie star, or stand in line behind someone at the drug store. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized this was unusual."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","mind_body","That's tough. I actually enjoy the benefit of age and how far I've come in my ""head"" since my 30s. But my grandmother was very senile by the time she passed away at 92, so I'm not sure I want that either. On the other hand, having the body of a 30 year old would certainly be helpful and beneficial as I age."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","famous","No, I don't think so. I'm not very comfortable in the limelight. I think I'd like to be known for being a good person, but no famous in a celebrity way."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","cute_baby","Oh, there are so many different things I've seen young kids do! I think one of the things that sticks in my head most is my own daughter when she was a baby. Before she could walk, we used to go to the park to have a little picnic and watch the kids play. One warm afternoon, I took a little box of watermelon with us so I could give her the rinds to chew on. I looked away to watch a soccer match, and before I knew it, she'd dug in to the watermelon with both hands, juice running all over the place. It was messy, but so sweet."
"R_1cUrEtCzaZmCj87","fire_rescue","Hm. I would make a final dash to grab a small cabinet that has all of our important information. It's got birth certificates, greencards, passports, etc. I mean, I'd want to collect other things, of course, but in the end it's all replaceable, isn't it?"

I also find these studies to be interesting. Having had some experience in collecting data for the museum I worked for, I find it neat to look at the way the studies are set up. I like to try and work out what the study is really about before the debrief."

"R_1DIKNcxbV3e55Zz","religious","God was a limiting mentality in my life. I was raised hard Catholic. I went to Catholic school for 12 years. He represented morals and a lifestyle I did not necessarily agree with. I suppose I woke up to the fact that a big old magic man in the sky wasn't going to determine my fate and wasn't going to send me to a fiery pit of torture if I didn't say I love him every day. He was a source of comfort, an imaginary best friend that I grew out of. I'm mature enoguh to accept my own consequences for my actions, to stand up for my own beliefs, and to inspire and motivate myself to do good for the sake of my own accomplishment rather than for the work of Christ."
"R_1DIKNcxbV3e55Zz","cute_baby","I don't really like kids that much. They actually annoy me and I don't find them cute. There are a lot of parents that secretly regret having kids and feel the need to tell you ""oh you'll change your mind"". No, I won't"

I foolishly don't have these things backed up anywhere else. Actually, your question reminds me of something that I have been meaning to look into and that is getting some sort of online backup storage subscription."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","garden","We planted a garden out front this summer because my daughter brought home some bean seeds from her preschool class. My husband bought a tomato plant for my son to plant so that he would have something to plant alongside my daughter's plants. The beans barely grew. There wasn't much to harvest. However, the tomato plant at the very end of the summer offered quite a few tasty snacks to the kids."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","mind_body","I would definitely retain the mind of a 30 year old. Too many times you hear stories of Alzheimer's patients and the struggles that their families go through because of the decline in their mental health. I would rather that my family had to struggle with taking care of me physically than mentally. At least mentally, I could still be happy and vital."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","religious","I was raised Catholic. While I am thankful for all of the teachings that going to church as a child gave me, I do not feel it is necessary to attend religious services on a weekly basis. I do believe in God. I think there has to be someone watching over us, through good times and bad. I am thankful for all that the Lord has provided me but I'm not sure how to pass my religious beliefs on to my children. That is something that I think about often when thinking about my own religious stance."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that I lived within 50 feet of where the local hospital landed its helicopter during emergency transports. When the helicopter wasn't there, it was a simple parking lot that my siblings and I would ride bikes on and roller blade on. But when the red lights on top of the light poles turned on, we knew a helicopter would be landing soon and we had to get off. Often, we would wait in the yard to watch it land as it flew over our house. We never tired of watching it."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","friend_value","What I value about friendship is the ability to confide in someone. If I can really trust someone to listen to me and offer sound advice without judgment, or at least without too much judgment, I can be friends with them forever. If I don't feel like I can talk to them, we probably aren't going to be close."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","how_raised","I would change that my parents wouldn't drink so much. Unfortunately in Wisconsin, drinking is a major part of the culture but in our household my parents were what you would call functioning alcoholics. While they provided for myself and my siblings very well, they didn't attend very many after-school activities and were not as involved in our lives as they could have been because they were chained to a bar-stool nearly every night of the week. I love my parents and I didn't have a bad childhood or bad teenage years but more supportive parents just by being there would have been helpful at times."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","why_studies","I do online studies as a supplement to my husband's income. I quit my job last year after having my third child because the guilt from not giving 100% to either my job or my children was very difficult to handle mentally. After I was home for a while, it became clear that we were just a tad short on income than what we needed to live a more simple but still comfortable lifestyle and that I was missing an essential piece of myself. I had worked since I was in high school and I was missing that feeling of really earning something. So to benefit my family's income and give myself some personal satisfaction, I started taking studies to earn a little extra money."
"R_1DMzzxpOP50Y3Ep","cute_baby","When my daughter was turning two years old, my mom and my sister came over to give her a birthday gift just as we were going to let her blow out the candles on her birthday cake. My daughter decided that she needed to sing along with us and at the end when we say, ""Happy Birthday to Adeline,"" she knew that this was the most important part so she belted it out, her name included. It was hilarious because she knew that we were singing the song to her but she basically wanted to sing it to herself too. It didn't hurt that at the time, she was just wearing a t-shirt with a big ""2"" on it and only a diaper."

I like that even if a long amount of time has passed, my friends and I never seem to miss a beat, it always seems like our last conversation never ended."
"R_1EXML11ZBSbgRpR","last_sing","I used to sing to my daughter every time we went for a trip in the car together.  Eventually, she could request what song she wanted me to sing while humming along. Now, my daughter sings to me every time we get in the car."
"R_1EXML11ZBSbgRpR","why_studies","I love doing online surveys! At first I began out of curiosity and to see if I could make some extra money. I quickly began spending a good majority of my free time completing surveys because they are surprisingly fun and often challenging. "
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","famous","Maybe I would. But I think it depends on what I'm famous for. I'd like to be known for making a great movie, or pushing the medium of animation forward or something like that. I'd less like to be known for being famous for just being famous. I'd like to be known for doing something good."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","religious","I don't consider myself very religious. Maybe slightly, but my beliefs differ from the norm. I believe more in a hands-off God who created the universe, but allows things to go about on their own with little outside interference. So I guess I'd consider myself slightly religious, but not extremely so."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","strangest","I guess it's a little out in the country, and it's on top of a big hill (almost a tiny mountain) which sits right above a town below it. So that might be a little weird. The nickname the hill has is weird. It's sometimes called ""Monkey Mountain"" even though there's no reason why."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","how_raised","Oh, I suppose maybe I would not have been home-schooled. But on the other hand, if I didn't do that I wouldn't have met my girlfriend. So it's hard to say. Maybe I would have liked it if I didn't have to live with foster kids when I was younger, as my parents were foster parents, and I didn't enjoy that. But overall I feel like things are fine the way they are."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","last_sing","I think I probably did some singing a few days ago. Sometimes I'll sing along when I'm doing other things and listening to Spotify in the background. I'm guessing that was the most recent time I did any singing."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","mind_body","I think I'd take the body. I imagine that if my body is of a healthy 30-year-old then my mind will likely be healthy too. After all, a healthy body and a healthy mind often go hand in hand. Seems like the best way to get both. Though, I'd probably be a freak of nature, looking 30-years-old but being almost a century old. But what can you do?"
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","cute_baby","I can't think of anything in particular. Babies are just cute by being themselves though. Everything they do is cute. I saw a picture of a cute baby recently, and it was cute just sitting there being itself."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","garden","No fruit trees or anything like that. One year I did grow watermelons though. They all died except for one that somehow managed to get hidden and avoided being eaten by the deer. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as ones you buy in a store, but it was a pretty big watermelon otherwise. I'm surprised it got so large and survived all the way until the fall when all the others died."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","friend_value","I value someone who is reliable. Someone who is there for you, and won't just up and abandon you. Basically, I expect them to be there for you. That's the most important thing to me."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","like_work","I'm technically unemployed, but I used to make videos for YouTube. I don't do it as much anymore, since YouTube kept messing with their algorithms and how ads are displayed and whatnot, and it makes it hard to make any money for anyone not a huge corporation. Now I mostly make my cash on MTurk. I like how easy some of the tasks are. I don't feel like I'm wasting my time."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","fire_rescue","I'd probably get my computer. It's got tons of important files and stuff on it. Even if I can't save the monitor, I'd at least save the tower with the hard drives in it. If I could save anything else it would be my game consoles, as I have a ton of downloaded games on them."
"R_1F2gedQoLUM528i","why_studies","I like them because they pay well. But beyond that, sometimes they're actually pretty interesting. Sometimes they're fun to do, too. It really all depends on the study. Some are way more interesting than others, while some can be real snooze-fests."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was yesterday. I like to sing in the car, because it relaxes me. I haven't song to anyone since my daughter was a baby. I would sing her to sleep every night."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","cute_baby","The cutest thing that I have seen a baby do is put there foot in their mouth. It always amazes me how flexible babies are. I love to see them playing with their toes and then all of a sudden their toes are in their mouth."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","how_raised","I really wish that my parents helped me have a sense of passion and drive. I feel like they never pushed me enough. They let me wander from on thing to next without ever telling me to focus on just a few things."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","garden","I have several fruit trees, including a lemon, apricot, fig, and avocado tree. I also grow my own vegetables in a container garden. I have tomatoes, onions, squash, berries, bell peppers, and chili peppers."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","fire_rescue","I would save my daughter's photos. I think that I would never be able to replace the photos from her childhood. I would want to save the photos more than anything so she could have them when she grows up."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","friend_value","I value the companionship and trust in a friendship. I like that I can turn to my friends at any time and they will be there for me. I always know that they are willing to support me no matter what I do."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was that there was a ghost in my house. The man who built and lived in the house died there. We would occasionally see him in our bedrooms, kitchen, or in the basement. The basement was the scariest place to see him though."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","like_work","I am a legal assistant. I prepare legal drafts and perform legal research. I like my job, because there is a certain amount of freedom and flexibility that comes with it."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","mind_body","I would want to travel more than anything. I have always wanted to travel the world and see what different cultures are like. I would want to stay in each country at least 6 months to soak up as much of the culture as I can."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","religious","I not really a religious person. I was raised Catholic, but I don't really follow the religion anymore. I would say I am more spiritual than religious."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","why_studies","I do these online studies, because I like to earn a little extra money for my family. I also find that they are challenging and engaging. I love that I learn something new from them everyday."
"R_1f766bKizDzPFjK","famous","I would not want to be famous. When I think about being famous, I think of the lose of privacy. I think of people always trying and possibly knowing what I do throughout my day."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","famous","Not really. I don't really like to have a lot of attention on me. If I had to be famous in some way though... I guess I would like to be famous after I die for being a saint. It would be nice to inspire people to be good and love God, but not have to deal with the fame or notoriety while being alive."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","last_sing","I sang to my son this morning. I have a terrible voice, but I always sing, ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" to my boys. I don't know why, but they like it."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","religious","Yes. I am a Roman Catholic. I believe that Christ not only came and died for us but that he left us a Church, which I believe to be the true Roman Catholic Church. I believe it was His will that we all go to heaven and that he left us The Church as the one and only means of getting there. "
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","why_studies","I do them for some extra money. We are trying to build up our own little off-grid oasis, but we don't really have any extra money in our budget. By squeezing in these surveys when and where I can, we have saved up a nice little extra chunk for it."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","cute_baby","That's a tough one. Pretty much everything they do is cute! Probably the cutest though is when my older son made my infant son laugh. My older son L was just goofing around throwing stuff, and my baby was watching him and just burst out into laughter. I think my heart almost burst from the overload of adorableness that it witnessed."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","garden","We own a small piece of property that we are trying to build up to be an off-grid haven. On there we try to do a small little garden every year, and we also have an orchard that we are developing. Currently, we have some apple trees, some walnut trees, and an almond tree, but we are hoping to get a lot more this year."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","fire_rescue","Probably my computer. I have so many pictures and so much information on it that would be difficult or impossible to replace. It would also be easier to start putting my life back in order if I did have it."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was that there were not any grocery stores or shops within twenty minutes of us. If we didn't plan properly, we were either out of luck or had to be greatly inconvenienced. I guess that isn't necessarily super strange unless you look at through the lens of how I currently live which is in the middle of suburbia, with any and everything within a few minutes."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","like_work","I am a writer and content developer for a small parenting content company. I love the people I work with as well the topic that we write about. Parenting is so important, and it is nice to have my full daytime job be so intertwined with what is one of the most important things to me, which is properly raising my children."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","mind_body","I would say the mind. Not only would it suck to not really have your faculties about you but it could also be pretty dangerous to have a nice young body, without the mind to go with it. You could end up in dangerous situations, that you wouldn't necessarily be able to think yourself out of."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","how_raised","If I could change one thing, it would be to have been better taught the Catholic faith. We grew up believing we were Catholic but did not realize that the last six men, including the current one, who have claimed to be popes were in fact anti-popes. If we had known our faith better, we could have identified them as such sooner, and not spent so much time in the fake Catholic Church."
"R_1fcSYoQBDBJMDq4","friend_value","I would have to say trust. Without trust, you can't ever really relax and enjoy yourself or the person. When you do have trust though, you can do things like make jokes without having to be overly concerned that the other person is going to take it wrong."
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","mind_body","If I were to live to the age of 90, I would want to retain my mind. Although it would be nice to have a body of a 30 year old, would I really enjoy myself if my mind was not proper. I would rather know who everyone was and be able to enjoy meaningful conversations. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","like_work","I am a homemaker. I love it because having kids was a dream of mine and I love that I am able to be here for them whenever they need me. I also did not have kids for someone else to raise them. I love that I am here to make life easier for my husband, who works very hard also. I feel very lucky to be able to stay home. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","how_raised","I wish I had been raised with more structure and guidance. My mom was a single mom with three kids so she worked all the time. I don't feel like I had many rules growing up, and in a sense, I was on my own. I think I struggled with a lot of confidence issues and I wish I had someone there who I could have talked to and confided in. I also think the lack of guidance caused me to make some poor choices, which really did affect my future. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a child do is when my niece was trying to teach her little sister how to walk. She was so persistent and kept saying ""just move your feet."" She tried so hard and couldn't really understand why she couldn't just stand up and walk right over to her.  "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","fire_rescue","Oh, that's a hard one. I actually think I would grab my computer. I know that doesn't seem very sentimental, but I have all my pictures stored on there. I think that would have me saving the most of my memories. "

"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was how safe it really was. I lived in an area of low income housing, as my mom was a single mom with 3 kids. We lived in a 4 plex. When I think back, everyone was friends and helped each other and looked out for one another. We didn't worry about being out late and we never heard of anyone being hurt or any robberies. Seems strange since it was a low income aread. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","friend_value","I value honesty and trust the most in a friendship. I want to know that I can trust my friend no matter what. I also think it is really important that they are honest with me. Sometimes I may not want to hear what they have to say, but it is what I need to hear. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","religious","I am not a religious person. Growing up we never went to church. I guess I have seen so many bad things happen that I feel if there really was a God, why would he let that happen. I have not had an easy life, and I feel a God would not let so many bad things happen to one person. "
"R_1FEfxO90Ab0ugUq","famous","I would not like to be famous. I think I am too much of a private person. I would not like to go places and always be recognized. I would not like people watching what I am doing all the time. "

"R_1FenbPQEPaJFGEg","strangest","I grew up in Queens, which is a part of New York City. I guess the strangest thing about growing up there is its appearance. When most people think of New York City, they think of skyscrapers. However, my neighborhood looks like many other residential areas in the country and consists of single-family houses."
"R_1FenbPQEPaJFGEg","mind_body","I have thought about this, but when I think about this, I think only about the outward appearance of the body. With that, I can accept aging gracefully on a physical level. However, I have so many experiences that I want to remember. I want to be able to acquire and remember even more. Therefore, if I had to choose, I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. "

I learned that it is, in fact, very easy to kill a cactus. So while I don't have a garden, I believe that is is best for me to admire plants and gardens tended by other people. "
"R_1FenbPQEPaJFGEg","last_sing","It's interesting, I actually used to be a really good singer. Most of the time when I sing now, it's to myself and in the shower or the kitchen. I was singing one of my favorite R&B songs yesterday while making oatmeal. I don't really sing to anyone else anymore. The last time that I did, I was in high school. "
"R_1FenbPQEPaJFGEg","religious","I am not a religious person. My mom isn't really religious, but I had a grandmother and many other relatives who were and are very religious. I went to a Pentecostal church as a child. As I got older, I noticed the hypocrisy in many people that were religious. I started to think of religion as another system aimed to control and judge, not a system that really brings people together. "

There are some studies where I have completed them learning more about myself. So it is a combination of interest and pay. "
"R_1FenbPQEPaJFGEg","famous","I would more so want a famous person's bank account as opposed to their actual fame. I wouldn't want to be famous because there is a lot of pressure to stay relevant and not to do anything that would hurt your reputation. Your mistakes are catalogued and seen by many people. I don't think that you get to be yourself when you're a famous person. "

Also, there are so many memories and contacts that I have on my phone. There's the last voicemail from my grandma on that phone. There's is also a voicemail from a friend that passed away. So, as silly as it sounds, I would dash back for my phone. "

"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","fire_rescue","I'm not much for sentimental things, so it would probably be more practical.  I would probably try to save the most valuable property asset that I could.  I would say that I'd make sure to get the car out of the garage.  I'm going to need that."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","why_studies","I enjoy keeping the mind active.  The nature of different studies helps to get the mind thinking in different ways.  Also, this is helpful in research, which is very important overall."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","religious","I am not that religious.  I was raised with some Sunday School and church, but not strict. I keep my options open as far as spirituality."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","famous","No, I really have no desire for fame.  I am much too reserved and quiet to want to be famous.  There are definitely a lot of benefits of fame, but the loss of private life and privacy is a big cost."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","friend_value","Well, that's a great question.  It's easy to enjoy the fun you have with each other, but I think that the real value most for me is in the down times.  I enjoy the support and reassurance I get from friendship, even if it is just listening and not feeling alone to deal with things.  That is the most valuable part.  It's also very difficult to specify."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","garden","I do grow some vegetables and herbs in a garden.  I don't have anything too exotic, just some tomatoes, squash, cucumbers and then cilantro, parsley, basil, and thyme for the herbs.  It is useful in cooking and helps to keep yardwork interesting."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","how_raised","Probably the learning and education portion.  Learning just to pass tests doesn't help kids in the long run, but it meets the standards for education.  Also, exposure to more areas and occupations in school."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","last_sing","Oh, the last time I sang to myself was in the car.  I will often sing and jam out while driving and listening to tunes.  The last I sang to someone else would be in the car as well, when a good song came on the radio."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","strangest","History of the area is very rich.  There is a lot of tradition of innovation in the culture of the area.  The history of the USA is very unique in how it developed and grew."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","mind_body","I would choose the mind.  I think that you can keep healthy and keep your body relatively young with exercise.  However, I think that it would/will be more frustrating to have a degradation in the mind over body."
"R_1g89KfZqFqRXNzC","like_work","I manage an office of financial service professionals.  I like the challenges of the position and working with a lot of great people.  I also enjoy the fact that we are able to help people meet their goals."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","like_work","I do a lot of things for work.  However, most of my income comes from delivery pizzas a few days a week.  It's really laid back and easy.  I sit around in my car and wait for deliveries to come up.  When an order comes in, I deliver the food and then collect money.  It's a great gig and I love it."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind.  I am very afraid of losing my mind.  I have a grandmother who has dementia and alzheimers, and it's really rough to see how she is.  She doesn't know her family.  She doesn't even know who her own husband is.  That's very scary.  I never want to be that way."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","famous","I don't think I'd want to be famous.  I feel that I would get too much attention.  I like living a life where I don't have to worry about going outside and being pestered by people.  I suppose if I were to be famous, I'd want to be famous in a very small niche like a famous banjo player.  Banjo music isn't really mainstream, so I feel that I would be able to go outside without people recognizing me."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","how_raised","I would wish my parents gave me more freedom.  I felt kind of sheltered.  I missed out on a lot of things that other kids did.  I felt that if my parents trusted me more, I could have learned more about how the world works.  "
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","why_studies","I do studies online to get money.  I can do them at my own pace which is pretty nice.  It's also pretty nice that it helps researchers learn more about people.  All in all, I do it for extra spending money though."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","friend_value","In friendship I value being able to enjoy shared experiences.  I like having friends that enjoy the same things I do, so that we may do things that we both enjoy and we can enjoy it together.  It's nice when we share hobbies because we can do things pertaining to the hobbies together."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was there was a cemetery in my backyard.  Sometimes I'd be in the backyard playing catch with my bad, and a family would show up to a grave of a loved one to mourn.  It was pretty strange playing in my backyard as a family is a few meters away crying to the loss of a loved one."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","garden","I grow a garden every year.  I currently don't have any plants in it because it's winter time and the weather is too cold.  However, every year I grow tomatoes, peppers, green beans, etc...  My favorite plants to grow are peppers.  I like to grow a lot of different types.  This year I grew Carolina Reaper peppers, and holy crap they were hot."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","cute_baby","One time I was out walking with my girlfriend and catching Pokemon.  I overheard one kid say to the other kid that there is a ""festival"" in town down the street.  The other kid responded by saying, ""A festival?! did you catch it?!""  The kid thought that ""festival"" was a type of pokemon.  It was adorable."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","religious","I am not religious at all.  I feel that science has concluded that a lot of people's religious beliefs are not real.  Science has quantifiable stuff that makes me learn about how the world works.  Most religions are fairy tales.  They are a good way to live your life, but it shouldn't be taken as fact."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","fire_rescue","I would save my banjo.  I really love playing music.  My banjo is something that is irreplaceable.  It has a certain tone that I've never heard from any other banjos.  It's very unique and one of a kind.  I love it."
"R_1GCxKeZQzw02bpY","last_sing","I play music in a band, and sometimes I sing along to our songs.  However, I'm a terrible singer and try to stay in the background.  I sing when we practice our music though.  I also sing in the shower and in the car all the time.  It's almost embarrassing how bad I sing though."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","like_work","I work as a backroom stocker at Target. I like it because it isn't that difficult of a job but it pays well and the people I work with are great. I've been working there for 7 years and I've never regretted a single day of my job."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","mind_body","Not that I wouldn't want my mind to work clearly, but I'd say that I'd rather have the body of a 30 year old. Not because I'm vain - I've never been pretty and never will be in this lifetime - but because I don't want to suffer with the bad health and aches and pains that may come with a 90 year old body."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","why_studies","I enjoy doing these online studies because they give me extra pocket money and they're not usually too difficult to do. I can earn an extra $25 a week just doing a few surveys a day, and I think that's great! I really enjoy working at MTurk doing surveys."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","famous","I would like to be famous only because I crave the attention. I really wouldn't like being famous because you also come under a lot of criticism, but I would love the attention so much that I wonder if I could deal with the criticism in order to have the adoration. I would prefer to be famous for something small, like running a Youtube channel, than to be on TV or in movies or on the stage."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","religious","I'm not a religious person, but I do consider myself to be spiritual. I'm not certain that I believe in ""God"" as it were, but I do believe in an afterlife. I feel very drawn to the idea of reincarnation and feel as if I have had other lives on this Earth before this one."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I would have been brought up around more kids and been taught to socialize at an early age. i suffered from shyness, extreme shyness, for many years, because I had such a solitary childhood where I didn't really have anyone around me. I feel that I suffered due to this for a very long time, and I wish I could change it."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","strangest","There really isn't anything strange about the place where I grew up. It's been a quiet neighborhood for my entire life, and I still live in the same house where I grew up. There aren't many loud or obnoxious neighbors, just nice people."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is someone who truly cares and listens. I have terrible insecurities about people not listening and only caring for you to shut up so they can get on with what they want to say, so someone who will listen and care and remember things I care about means the world to me. I would of course listen and care in return!"
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","last_sing","I sang to myself earlier this morning when something I was watching online reminded me of a song. I can't think of the last time that I sang to someone else. I usually sing on my own."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","garden","I don't currently have anything like a garden. I don't even have a houseplant. But in my youth, we had a berry bush in the back yard of my house that we used to pick berries from and eat them each summer. I really loved that berry bush."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","fire_rescue","If my house caught on fire and I could only save one thing besides my loved ones and pets, I'm not sure what I would take. Once upon a time I would have said either my photo albums or my VHS tapes, because it would be hard to ever replace them. But most things are stored online these days, and there aren't many possessions I still have that I'd like to take with me so badly that I would choose that thing over everything else. Of course, I'd like to save my computer! The expense of getting a new one would be rough."
"R_1GDiVMIftWGGKM6","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby or child do is say something adorable. It's always surprising, the things a young child can come up with even at a very young age. Things you'd never expect them to say."
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","religious","No, though I've gone to church several times lately. I just feel like I can figure out my own problems. I've gone to church to get that positivity, but honestly I could live without it. "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","strangest","That everyone can get along but then hate each other at the drop of a dime. It's all love until *something*, then it isn't. It's weird..."
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","friend_value","What do they value in me? That means more to me than anything else honestly. I don't need anyone else in life except for my dog. So basically, like what I like or get ignored. "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","how_raised","Nothing. Thank God I had the parents I did. I grew up in the hood and most of my friends are dead or locked up. "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","mind_body","I'm choosing the body 100 times out of 100. That way, I can still have sex...but because I have the mind of a 90 year old, I can just shrug off all the times 30 year olds deny me on some, ""I'm old and didn't know what I was doing"" :-) yes! "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","famous","Nope. Leave me alone. I wear a hoodie in public because I don't want to be bothered."

"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","garden","I have a garden, and I love it. I give it tender care throughout the spring/summer and it gives me yummy vegetables. Heck, I like my garden more than most of my friends..."
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","fire_rescue","My teddy bear. His name is ""teddy"", and I've had him since I was born. He came to college with me and even survived my soon to be ex-wife's rage. He's been with me for 38 years and I'd probably grab him before I didn't anything other than get my dog. "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","cute_baby","Smile. I'm not a father, nor do I ever intend to be, but the most beautiful/pure thing in the world is a baby's smile. When you hold them, they look into your eyes and smile...nothing like that. "
"R_1GJh8sb8k6LWmhL","why_studies","I do these online studies for extra income, frankly. Occasionally, I'll find a few that tickle my fancy and let me think about the world in a different way...but that said, those are rare. Like I said, I'm grinding...used to sell drugs as a side-hustle, but losing my main income because of that isn't/wasn't worth it..."

Recently went through (and I suppose I still am going through) a divorce that really doesn't need to be as contentious as it is (women, right?), so while I'm still teaching, I'm doing so online so I can spend more time at home. Why do I need to be at home? Because my wife (finally) was ordered to leave MY house, and she left it a mess...picture a crackhouse. ugh. "

It makes no sense to me that although nearly every people group over the history of the world has had some kind of religious belief, somehow THIS belief (whatever you grew up with, or chose, or whatever), at THIS time in the entire history of the world, is the RIGHT one.  It's more likely that NONE of them are true.  Humans are natural storytellers, and religious beliefs are just stories that we tell in order to attempt to understand the world.  It doesn't make them factual."

When you can really trust someone, whether it be with information, your most guarded secrets, or just to trust that they will be there for you, it will prove to be a good relationship. It hurts when someone you think you can trust betrays you."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous. Too many people would know too much information about me. I like my privacy so I would not like that invasion at all. In addition, I don't like taking pictures. I also am very much a homebody and don't really like getting approached by strangers."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","mind_body","I would prefer to retain the mind of a 30 year old. As much as I would want to have a young body, it sometimes scares me to think that I could lose my knowledge of certain things and need help to do basic things. Plus, it would look weird to be a certain age but look like a 30 year old."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","garden","The only ""plant"" I have are some roses in front of my house. They're dead now because it's winter, but they looked beautiful during the summer. I would like to branch out and have more flowers in my yard next summer. My mother has many beautiful flowers, and her yard is gorgeous."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","cute_baby","I love a child's laugh. I think the cutest thing a baby or child can do is giggle. It is even cuter when they find something particularly funny, and they do a deep laugh from the belly that usually continues because they can't stop. It makes me very happy to hear that sort of laugh."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","fire_rescue","I would probably save my laptop mainly because of the cost of the item. There is nothing else in my house that I'm especially attached to. Everything else can be replaced pretty easily (and so can the laptop), but I would save it because I can then use it in the following days to file claims and replace other things."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","religious","I wouldn't consider myself a religious person. I believe in the existence of God, and I grew up going to Church. But I wouldn't call myself religious because I don't really ""turn to"" God in different times of my life. I don't pray to very much either."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was that the school in my neighborhood was very small. It's strange to me because each grade had no more than 20 students, and I graduated from the 8th grade in a class of about 15 students. Whereas where I am now, there are about four classes of 20 for each grade in school."
"R_1H8p896YhYd5XU8","why_studies","I do these studies to make a little extra money. You can't get rich, but if you do quick ones that have a decent dollar amount attached to them, you can make some pocket change. I've been doing them more recently to make some extra money to buy Christmas gifts early for my family."
"R_1hQYH88XbZnALvG","mind_body","I would want a 30 year old mind. That is more valuable. A body is not worth much if you can't use it."

"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","famous","No I would not like to be famous. I don't like to be the center of attention. I am a private person and like to lead a private life."
"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","friend_value","I value trust in a friendship the most. Trust is important because you know that you can depend upon or say anything to a friend and they will keep it between the two of you. If you can't trust your friends whats the point of having friends in the first place."
"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is speak his or her first words. It is always cute to hear a baby say momma or dadda. I think a child's first words are priceless."
"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","why_studies","I do online studies for extra money. I use the extra money for bills or for shopping. It enables me to also spend more when I am out at night with friends."
"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","how_raised","I would change the effort that was taught to do well in school. I feel sometimes I wasn't pushed hard enough for my own good. I would have liked to see more demand from my mom."

"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","religious","Yes I a a religious person and have a strong belief and faith in god. I love our heavenly father and try to walk in his footsteps the best I can. He died for our sins so that is why I am a big follower of the lord."
"R_1i8tD8ALIfxjVzb","mind_body","I would definitely choose living longer while having a young mind. The mid is a powerful thing and it's important to keep it sharp. I feel that mind and wisdom comes before looks and beauty."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","cute_baby","I can't remember anything that I thought another baby or child do. I can however, remember the cutest thing that I did as a child. I have a picture of myself when I was four years old, my shirt has a number four on it and I am holding up four fingers to show how old I am."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","garden","I have plants, but I don't have fruit trees or a garden. I don't need fruit trees because there is enough fruit at the store. I don't need a garden because there is enough plant life in the area that I live in."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","why_studies","I have two reasons why I do these online studies. I think that the tasks are interesting to do. I also like the money that I make from them."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30- year old. The mind is such a powerful thing in life as far as getting things done. The mind is more important than the body in order to empower yourself."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","how_raised","I would change the fact that I was not from a wealthy family. I also would not be from the USA. I think that those two things are not to much to want."

"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","fire_rescue","I would get a bag and then put my secret stash box in it. This box contains secret files that I cannot let strangers know about. I would also save some of my religious items. I would save these items because they are difficult to replace."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","strangest","There is nothing strange about the town that I grew up in. The only thing that I would say is different from many places is the fact that there are a lot of hills in the town. This is something different about the town, but I don't think that it is strange."
"R_1IBgq40cTgQ6X4n","religious","I am a religious person. I believe that I live in a religious way with the way that I am involved in my community. I believe that I follow the rules of my religion enough in life."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","religious","I am absolutely not religious at all. I was sent to eight years of Catholic school and somewhere around the end of it I realized that it just didn't make any sense and it's all just a fantasy story. Also I majored in philosophy in college which only solidified those beliefs."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","famous","I would love to be famous. I think it would be incredibly easy to get laid and you could probably devise some way to get rich off of the fame. If I could choose which way, I'd be a professional athlete, that way I'd also be in good shape!"
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","friend_value","I probably value loyalty the most. A friend is someone who you can count on and if they aren't loyal to you then they aren't much of a friend. You know what they say: ""a friend in need is a friend indeed."""
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","last_sing","That has to be at least 5 years ago. I can't remember ever singing to myself, but I have done some karaoke. I remember singing Baby Got Back in karaoke with some friends. We are all very white so it was incredibly awkward but a lot of fun."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","why_studies","Whenever I have a spare hour or so with nothing really to do, it's an interesting thing to do. Some studies give you a perspective on life or psychology that can be fascinating. Also, not to mention it's nice to have just a little extra money."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","fire_rescue","Definitely my desktop computer. I basically live on my computer so I might even save it over my loved ones and pets. It so many things on it that I couldn't bear to lose, it would be like the loss of a child if I couldn't save it."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","garden","I don't anymore but in the house I grew up in we had an apple tree in our backyard. The apples were awful, even when perfectly ripe they were extremely tart and basically inedible to me. However, the deer liked them and so it was nice to have some cool animals come around to look at because of the tree."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","strangest","The strangest thing is probably our school mascot. It's called the Hodag and it's this mythological giant green lizard with a huge head and sharp claws and spikes along it's back. It was supposedly made up by loggers to scare away other people from their lands."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","cute_baby","Well you probably know that I don't like kids or babies at all so this is a hard question. I do however like cats, and that reminds me of a video where a cat walks up to a clearly distraught child and comforts him. The cat literally just hugs him and it makes everything better."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","like_work","I'm a bartender. I work at this little hole in the wall restaurant and it's really fun to chat all day with a lot of different people. It's also great that the income is mostly in tips so you can hide money from the government and pay less taxes."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","how_raised","When I grew up my parents were very sheltering. They never let me do anything that could remotely hurt me so I grew up very timid and scared. Furthermore they sent me to eight years of Catholic school which was so awful."
"R_1IjOixFzv01Ti1P","mind_body","That's a tough question, probably the mind. I figure if I have the body of a 30 year old but an old mind, the body is sort of worthless because I won't have the brain faculties to use it effectively. However, with a 30 yr old mind I can always read books and do other activities that only require mental power."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","friend_value","I value trust, reliability, and understanding. Being able to trust someone is the most important part of a friendship. Reliability is important because you need to be able to depend on your friends. Understanding is also important because friends need to be able to be flexible with life circumstances. "
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","why_studies","I do these online studies because my family really needs the money. My husband works full time and I stay home with the kids. The little bit of extra money helps us with our groceries."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","fire_rescue","I would most likely not risk it and stay outside. However, if I did have to run back in, I would grab the family laptop. It has all of our family pictures in it and music too."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","cute_baby","Today, I made faces at a little boy in the post office and he kept giggling. He was very cute and well behaved. I hid behind my envelope and would pop my head up and make a face and he'd laugh."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","religious","No, I am not a religious person. I don't believe in god, I only believe in science. I am an atheist. "
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","garden","Yes, we have apple trees, a cherry tree, and blueberry bushes at my house. My husband does all of our gardening. He also has a small garden where he grows vegetables. "

"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","strangest","There really isn't many strange things about the town where I grew up. It's a small colonial town and I still live there. One funny thing is that we celebrate the fourth of July two weeks late every year because that's how long it took it took to get the message on horseback in 1776."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","how_raised","I would give my family more money so my dad wouldn't have to worry so much. I would like to be encouraged to read more. I would also choose not to have gotten a dog."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","famous","No, I would never want to be famous. I really value my privacy and I feel bad sometimes that famous people have to sacrifice their privacy for their art. I like that Sia covers her face during performances so people don't know what she looks like and she can continue making music without giving up her privacy."
"R_1ikQFsVTnm0wTxe","mind_body","I would want the body of a 30 year old, not the mind. With age, we learn and gain wisdom. It would be a great life advantage to have the wisdom of a 90 year old with the body of a 30 year old."

"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","fire_rescue","A jewelry box that my husband made for me. It was the first wood working project he ever did. He had found the Alligator wood down on a fire assignment in New Mexico and carried the wood with him back here to Idaho. He spent months creating this beautiful little jewelry box without my knowledge. At the end he burned an inscription into the underside of the lid with a very heartfelt and meaningful message to me. Every day for years I've looked at that box and it means the world to me. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","like_work","It depends on your definition of work. For money right now I'm just on Amazon Turk. I like that I can do it whenever I want. But I also hatch and raise chickens and turkeys to sell as well as selling farm fresh eggs. It doesn't exactly make much but  birds a passion of mine. Most of my actual work goes into homeschooling and raising my kids and working our farm. That is real work. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","how_raised","Oh, this is a tough question. In a lot of ways I wouldn't change much. I had hundreds of acres to run, horses, dogs, birds, goats, llamas, pigs, practically any animal I could manage to find. I had a ton of freedom and adventures. But I could have done without the alcoholism, narcissism, abuse, drugs, bankruptsey, losing our home, the fighting, the lies, the hiding from people, and the shame. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","strangest","We lived on the outskirt of a tiny little unincorporated town, that had maybe 10 families. There was a sign on the highway when you drove in that described the number of cattle, horses, and goats in the town, and then the number of people. Something like ""800 cattle, 200 horses, 150 goats, 40 people."" It made it obvious that it was an extremely rural farm area. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","why_studies","I do these because I could use a few extra bucks to help pay for my kids birthday and christmas presents. Some of them are actually very interesting and make a person use their brain, such as this one. I'm currently enjoying this one, as this is probably the most conversation I'll get to have for awhile. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","friend_value","I think I value comfort the most. When I'm friends with someone I want to be able to have them come to my house despite it being a disaster some times. Or they feel like they're able to ugly cry and eat a pint of ice cream together. I don't want there to be competition or pretense. Just a mutual exchange of friendship."
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","religious","I am not a religious person. I am pantheistic. I believe that religion on a whole is a very deceitful, angry, historically bloody and vicious tool of indoctrination that is used to control large populations and keep them blind and stupid. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","garden","Yes, I have all three. We have various plum, apple, and rosehip trees and shrubs on our acreage. I constantly keep a variety of herbal and medicinal plants growing in my house as well as outside as the weather allows. We have a seasonal garden that is about 1/4 of an acre. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. A body is a semi useless bag of water that can be so easily harmed and inhibited. At 90 I would love to be able to think as clearly and freely as I do now. Thoughts are better food to the mind than a body. "

I sang to my children this morning as well. We sang ""The Wheels On The Bus."" They thought it was a lot of fun as we went through all the movements. "
"R_1ilMTVNgyW1SmfV","cute_baby","This is a tough one. I have two absolutely adorable children so I don't know that I can pick just one. I suppose if I had to, I would say currently I'd choose when my 3 year old son climbs into bed with me in the early morning to snuggle. He always grabs my face, kisses me, and sleepily says ""I uv you momma."" And then drifts back off to sleep while snuggled up tight to me. He's really the sweetest little guy. "

"R_1ILxpIphPDuHonz","mind_body","It depends.  The mind of a 90 year old could be in excellent shape.  I'll say this- I value the mind far, far above the body, so if I had to choose Id opt for the mind.  But the mind of a 30 year old lacks experience and understanding.  If we're just talking about plasticity and ability to remember and so forth, then the mind is an easy choice for me.  "
"R_1ILxpIphPDuHonz","strangest","It was obscenely wealthy.  The usual domestic turmoil was hidden beneath a veneer of superiority and narcissism.  It was surreal to grow up among people whose main, if not only value, was wealth accumulation."
"R_1ILxpIphPDuHonz","why_studies","Sometimes I enjoy doing them.  But mostly its for a little extra spending money.  The trade-off for working in book publishing is you dont get rich, generally speaking.  Fine with me.  Turking allows me to get  couple extra things I might not otherwise."

"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","mind_body","I would much rather have the mind of a young 30 year old for the rest of my life than to have the body of one. I think it would be much better to have a healthy mind than to have a young body. In my opinion, If your mind goes, it really doesn't matter how good of a body you have. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","cute_baby","For some reason, when my brother was a baby, he used to find hiccups to be extremely hilarious. Sometimes when my mother would be feeding him, she would get the hiccups. He would immediately start laughing and giggling. His laugh was so bubbly and adorable. Seeing him laugh like this as a baby was probably the cutest thing I've ever seen. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","friend_value","In a friendship, I most value having somebody that accepts me for who I am. I don't have to pretend to be somebody who I am not. Instead, I can be myself and know that my friend likes me for me, including all my flaws and weaknesses."
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","fire_rescue","I would dash in and save an old antique vase that has a lot of meaning to me and my family. This vase has been passed down from generation to generation in my family. Its a cherished heirloom and I would hate for it to be destroyed. Therefore, I would definitely make sure to save this vase if my house was ever caught on fire. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","religious","I am completely not a religious person. As I grew up, I started doubting religion and questioned everything about it. The more I questioned, the more I found out that nobody really had any answers. It was hard for me to believe in something that was purely based on faith with no real proof. As I got older, I just completely separated myself from religion. It is just not something that is important to me whatsoever. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","how_raised","This is a hard question, considering that I've always admired the way my parents raised me. I guess I would have to say that the only thing I would change would be the amount of responsibility my parents placed on me at a young age. They always expected the best out of me, and sometimes it could be stressful for a young kid. I could have probably done better with a little less stress as a youngster. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","strangest","I grew up in a small mountain town. There used to be an old abandoned home in the forest not too far from where I lived. It was rumored that it was haunted and many people in town used to say that it was a very evil place. People wouldn't even venture out near the house because they were truly scared of it. I think this has to be the strangest thing about where I grew up, hands down. "

"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","famous","In my opinion, fame isn't all glitz and glamour as it appears on television. I think it would become tiring having people stalk you all day and record your every move. I think you lose a lot of privacy and comfort when you become famous. I would much rather be rich, and not famous. Fame is completely not for me. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","why_studies","There are two reasons why I do these online studies. First of all, I use the money I make to pay off my credit card bills every month. It definitely helps ease my financial burden. Secondly, I like being able to provide help for academic research. I like the idea that my efforts can actually provide some valuable data. "
"R_1IszHoiVUlArZCh","last_sing","I sing to myself every day in the shower! I love music and find myself singing to myself throughout the day. Because I can be shy, I just can't imagine myself singing to somebody else. "

He was always trying to replicate it and wink back but, obviously, didn't have the motor skills to do so.  His face would wind up being a squished up, with one eye open wide and the other squinting. It's hard to describe, but it was terribly cute!"
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","garden","I have a few house plants inside, thought I'm not that great at remembering to water them.  Each summer, I plant a garden in my back yard. I usually grow tomatoes, various herbs, lettuce, arugula, potatos, and strawberries."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","friend_value","I value so many things in friendship. I suppose if I had to pick one thing, it would be empathy. People who can really put themselves in the shoes of others, who don't judge, and who really and truly feel for and want to help others make wonderful friends!"
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","strangest","I grew up in an upper class suburb. The strangest thing about that was that my family was poor. My parents had purchased a tiny house, right on the border when they first married. Everyone I went to school with lived in half a million dollar homes and their parents were very well off.  We struggled, the house was in poor condition, and I always felt out of place."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","how_raised","My parents were extremely distant. They never talked to us about anything of great significance. I was not comfortable going to them when I had a problem so, I'd just wallow in it. They also didn't show affection. Even now, decades later, I know that ability to build close relationships is challenged because of that."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","mind_body","I'd definitely choose to keep my mind sharp and smart. I think that, with a good diet and exercise program, I could stay pretty healthy and mobile. So, I could maintain autonomy. Being of sound mind as you age is very important."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","fire_rescue","I would likely save a box of photographs. Many of them, from recent years, I have stored digitally. But, I also have a lot of pictures from my childhood, of my grandparents, etc that I haven't scanned in yet. So, if they burned, those memories would be gone forever."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","religious","I'm not at all religous. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended Catholic school for eight years. I came away from it really disliking the practice. I find organized religion to often be oppressive and descriminatory so, now I don't practice any religion."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","why_studies","I started doing these studies during a period of unemployment. I definitely wasn't making enough to support myself but, I was grateful to have some income to buy groceries, pay for bus fare, etc. Even though I have a job now, I keep doing them partly because I enjoy them, but also because the money I make allows me to provide extras for my family and save a bit each month."
"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous. I really value my privacy. I also don't like crowds. I think that it would be really stressful most of the time. For instance, just going out with friends or running to the store, you'd probably always be recognized and expected to engage with fans."

"R_1j6re7aMuoDkRrl","last_sing","I attended the birthday party of my neighbor's child a few days ago. We all, of course, sang Happy Birthday to the child.  I think that's the last time. I listen to music all day while I'm at work but, I hardly ever sing along."
"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that it is common place to get a pickle at the movie theater and people think that this is normal. I had no idea after leaving Texas that not only do other states not do this, that they think it is very weird. Pickles go well with popcorn, what can I say?"

I accidentally knocked something off the table and he started to stir. I continued what I was doing and put the thermometer under his arm. As I was waiting for a reading, he opened his eyes and said, ""hey chica, I think you are pretty cute."" It's the best compliment I have ever received. "
"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","mind_body","Probably the body. I know that sounds shallow but it's not about having the body of of a 30 year old in terms of physique. It's because I think with age comes wisdom and I never want my mind to out live my body. For example, I don't want to be 90; old and with poor functioning but with my mind racing like a 30 year old. I would feel that if I had a 30 year old's mind I would be stuck in a cage with just my own thoughts,  not being able to express my thoughts physically. "
"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","why_studies","I do these online studies because I find then socially interesting and because I have down times in my job. I enjoy contributing to some understanding of human behavior. I have done a few medical research studies that I have enjoyed and this is another way I can contribute without taking away free time that I have. It is much more intellectually stimulating than scrolling through facebook all day."

"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","how_raised","I wish that I was not raised in such a well off community. I know that sounds stuck up to say. When you are surrounded by people with endless amount of money and your parents finances are on the lower side of finite, it created a feeling that we were not good enough. "

"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","friend_value","I value uniqueness in my friendships. The relationship that I have with everyone of my friends is different from other. I do not expect any one thing out of any one particular friend. They all just flow how they are suppose to. "
"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","like_work","I am a pediatric nurse and right now I do telephone triage. I give parents advise about their kids over the phone. I really like that I can work from home but mainly it is because I like talking to people "
"R_1jdFk4Xeq1XSAw2","religious","That depends on how you define religious. If you mean do I believe in a higher being, then yes I am religious. If you mean do I follow people that subscribe to a particular religious doctrine, then no. I have not been able to find anything that makes sense to me. I am not against religion. I think that in general religion teaches you to just be a good person but I don't know how not eating swine has anything to do with being a good person. "

I if I could only save one thing it would probably be an old Guatemalan purse of my grandmothers. It has a pin attached to it that was given to them at their local pool in the 1950s. It is really special to me. "

You get a great sense of accomplishment when you have a great and successful campaign for a client. "

Its a cool community effort and they are teaching us about the importance of growing our own food and eating local. They also have flowers they grow there and its a nice meeting spot to see people from the community. "

Also I would be able to still workout and play games that I love. I value taking care of my body and keep in shape so I would like to keep that up in old age. "
"R_1jE9nhkwGNbytic","strangest","The strangest thing about where i'm from is the old cemetery. When we were little everyone would always tell us it was haunted and to stay away from it. One Halloween we went to it and got really freaked out and scared. I don't think its really haunted but it is very scary and strange. "
"R_1jE9nhkwGNbytic","why_studies","I do these studies in order to get money to buy books off of Amazon. I also do them because sometimes they are very interesting and you can learn new things. I also like the challenge of some of the studies where you get to play a game and have a chance to earn a bonus. "
"R_1jE9nhkwGNbytic","religious","I am not a religious person. I got confirmed as a Presbyterian but stopped following shortly after. I though about what religion ment to me and it did't make much sense. Theres no physical evidence god exists and the bible is just tales told by other people and not god himself. I can't be religious until I get some hard proof that God existed. "
"R_1jE9nhkwGNbytic","how_raised","I would change living in the suburbs for living in a real city. Even though the suburbs are ok you get real culture in cities. You see people from all over the world and all walks of life. You learn how to adapt to environments your not familiar with and how to overcome them. Also i love public transportation like trains and buses instead of taking a car everywhere. "
"R_1jE9nhkwGNbytic","last_sing","I sung to myself early today. I was on the train listening to music on my phone and started mouthing the words. I really liked the song and couldn't help but to start singing along like I was in the band. "

I would be able to get access to a lot of things only famous people can get to and that would be so thrilling. Although fame also has some downsides like people constantly harassing you I would still take it over being unknown. "

The baby was at the glass and the dolphin noticed her. She kept putting her hands on different parts of the glass and the dolphin would bump its nose on the glass every time she moved her hands, it was adorable. "
"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","famous","I definitely wouldn't want to to be famous.  I have a pretty big fear of criticism, even if I think everyone daydreams of doing flashy and showy things.  At the end of the day, I think I'd rather just have a job or an activity where I'm respected.  Becoming famous can be for both good and bad reasons, after all."
"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","last_sing","I am way too shy to actually sing to someone else since I've never had any professional training and never participated in group singing before.  However, I do sing to myself a lot, I suppose.  I think the last time I did so was the other day, while listening to music while working."
"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","friend_value","I really value empathy and having someone to listen to me.  Of course, having shared interests where we can talk about things we enjoy is pretty important.

It's pretty hard to make sure I don't slack off at times.  In the end, however, I think it is pretty worth it being able to manage my own hours and make calls on my own.  I'm also able to have the time to dedicate myself to what I want to do next in life."

We also have a few smaller plants here and there, but we live in the middle of the woods."

"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","mind_body","I would definitely want to retain my mind.  I would hope that I would retain my mind, regardless, but old age affecting one's body is something that I kind of expect.  With degenerative diseases and the like that can effect the brain, you can't guarantee your mind will still be there.  However, you can generally take an active approach to protecting your body.  Of course, this is on the assumption there's no other things wrong."

I was in a class that had a crossover class with a daycare or childcare class of some sort.  I liked to see some of the kids I encountered there get to express themselves with drawing."
"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","religious","Sort of but not really.  I was raised to be somewhat religious, but it is a pretty decentralized thing in my life.  I find that it is more important to treat others with respect and with kindness than to stick to a hard set of religious rules."
"R_1jEdZFegEtNmzjv","how_raised","Mostly stuff with my father, given he wasn't around too much.  I also kind of wish I was more dedicated with school or that I could have been better at things.

Oak Ridge is pretty famous for national labs and the history of the atomic bomb.  It's pretty prevalent in the small town's image of itself and by the fact there is a strong scientific presence there for somewhere in the southern United States."

"R_1k0Uysiuyw1Kokg","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that I grew up on a dead end street. At the very end of the street there was a very steep hill that we were all afraid to fall down when we were kids. I'm not afraid to roll down it anymore and it would actually probably be pretty fun. "
"R_1k0Uysiuyw1Kokg","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've ever seen a baby do is play with pets. When babies play with pets they seem so innocent and amused and like they are having the time of their life. Sometimes they even attempt to make the same sounds that the animal does and it is very adorable. "
"R_1k0Uysiuyw1Kokg","religious","I wouldn't consider myself much of a religious person at all. My family is pretty religious and I was taught all about this when I was younger, but I just don't feel that I fully believe in the things that I was taught. I would consider myself agnostic, as I am not fully sure whether I believe in a god or not. "

"R_1K24XKdiUE2HBwz","why_studies","That is a great question.  I suppose it's because I felt like I was wasting a lot of my life playing video games.  At least with this, I'm earning extra money and it's kind of like playing computer games. "

"R_1LBGc6ouGM3Aqwr","mind_body","If I were to live to the age of 90, I would have to pick to retain the mind. If I'm still living at that age, I would want to be able to think and do for myself and not have to rely on others to think for me. Even though I would love to have a body like that of a 30 year old, I don't see how that will help me in decision making if I don't have a great mind to go along with it. "

Of course, money is truly what motivates me. I live in a rural area and work a job that is kind of all consuming responsibility wise. I need extra money and don't have the time to work or commute to a second job. It's much easy for me to take breaks on MTurk and sweep up some extra pennies in between my real job's demands."
"R_1LhXRKmxqjqMFib","mind_body","Definitely the mind. I would imagine watching your body age is incredibly good for your character and humility. Also, imagine living another 60 years!

"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","strangest"," I guess the strangest thing about where I grew up was we lived across from a bar down the road from the gun shop.  Late at night drunk people would show up on doorstep trying to sell with steaks.  They never had anything in hand so that was kind of strange."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","like_work"," I’m a customer service manager with dish network.  The best part of my job is getting to promote people.  From the time I teach them how to interview to prepping their resume to being there for them before and after the interview it’s just the best part of the job."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","why_studies"," After the adoption of her son we found out he had severe medical conditions and struggled with mental illness. We went to check our insurance it didn’t cover anything pertaining to mental health.  So over half of each of our check goes to giving him the care he needs and sometimes that means going without.  We adopted another something then to him I never want him to feel what I felt growing up not having enough to eat. So I do this so he will never have to know what it’s like to go hungry."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","how_raised"," After my parents divorced we had very little money.  We live paycheck to paycheck and didn’t always know where we were going to get shoes or food or even live.  If I could change anything it would’ve been making it easier on my mom who never gave up even with those adversities."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","last_sing","I’m not comfortable with my own voice and less I’m singing purposely off key happy birthday and making a scene at work. I’m not a natural singer so that would be the only time I did it as a joke.  Finally I just help my feet but every once in a while when no one else is home and my headphones are blasting I sing a few lyrics and my dog howls along."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","garden","Yes I love to garden but we just moved across country so our garden changed.  We had a townhouse before Where our backyard is just covered in all the vegetables and herbs. Now that we’ve moved to Denver  I have a basil plant, a tomato plant and a pepper plant on the back patio. As soon as winter passes I’m going to plant a whole bunch more herbs but they will be in buckets hanging from the patio."
"R_1mJmAGcVlyowhfn","fire_rescue","If my house is burning down and my family and pets for safe I would probably grab my wedding book but that would probably be a tossup with that and getting the laptop which has all the photos.  I think memories are important as you age those memories fade so that’s more important than any other object to grab in my home."
"R_1mKtngWhwgMoSux","last_sing","I can't remember when I last sang on any particular occasion. I remember my mother used to sing to me when I was a child, but I don't remember anything specific. I don't really find music all that interesting."

"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","friend_value","Loyalty is probably what I value most. Shared experiences and shared interests are important, too, and my best friends have those things in common with me. But ultimately, what I value most, is knowing that they will be there when I need them just like I will be there if they need me, even if its been ages since we've seen each other."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","last_sing","I sing to my kids in the care pretty much every day, does that count? I can kind of remember as a kid hearing my parents sing quietly to the car radio but I like to belt it out and be confident. Sometimes it gets my kids into singing along with me, but I'm sure sometimes it embarrasses them as well, and I think both things are important. Kids should be embarrassed by their parents on a regular basis, but they should also see that I'm confident and not self-conscious and hopefully help them to be that way as well."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","how_raised","There's not a lot I would change about the way I was raised. While I was growing up, I had supportive parents in a suburban neighborhood, which gave me both freedom and stability. When we moved overseas, it gave me one of the most unique experiences of anyone I know. And then when my parents divorced and we moved back to the States, it was rough emotionally, but it ended up giving me the independence to become the person I am now."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","like_work","I'm an analyst for work, but it sounds more important or involved than it actually is. Most of the work I'm involved in is accomplished by contractors' and it's merely my job to ensure that their work gets done. I make sure authority is transferred so they can get the job done, and have some liability if things aren't done, but for the most part I don't touch any actual 'analysis.'"
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","strangest","I think the strangest thing was that our neighborhood was near a busy road, a farm, a forest, and new construction. Behind the houses across the street was a cotton field where we would build huge snow fort battles in the winter, but if you went up the road and through a short stretch of woods there was a Domino's and other shops. Right across the street the other way there was a new subdivision slowly being built where we could ride our bikes in the mud. It was a bunch of wildly different places for us to explore."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","cute_baby","Last night I was watching a show in bed with my wife while we were trying to let my toddler fall asleep. The show had horses in it, and every time they came on the screen my daughter would sit up with big round eyes, point at the screen, and go 'Oh. Oh!' She has been playing a lot with her sister's toy horses and I think that was the first time she'd seen them as real animals."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","garden","Absolutely not. I joke that I have two brown thumbs. My yard is actually pretty lush, but that's mostly with weeds and a few horrible gumball trees that I would cut down in a heartbeat if I had a chance. Last spring we actually weeded, cleared out, and relined our flower bed out front... then we were too lazy to plant anything in it and it has gone completely sallow in the meantime."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","fire_rescue","Our wedding album. It's not irreplaceable, but it nearly is. Everything truly important we have stored in a fire safe that we could recover after the fire, and all our accounts and information on our computers we have backed up elsewhere so we could recover those as well. The wedding album is the most important thing that would be the hardest to replace."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","why_studies","Extra cash, plain and simple. My income goes to my bills, my kids, and everything that goes into our quality of life. But the money I earn here can't really go towards that stuff, not easily anyway, so by spending a few hours doing online studies each month I earn a little disposable income that I can do whatever I want with. It helps me be more frugal with my actual income while still getting to splurge on little things I want from time to time."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","famous","Fame is a dangerous thing, I think. If I were to be famous, I'd want it to be for my actual skills. I'd love to be a famous author like Patrick Rothfuss or Brandon Sanderson, kind of cult-famous, the biggest fish in a small pond sort of thing, not famous like Stephen King. Mostly, I'd like to be famous enough to support my family with ease and be able to do good things for causes I care about, but not so famous that all my privacy and freedom is stripped away."
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","mind_body","I would definitely choose to keep the mind of a 30-year-old. I have come to terms with the idea that my body will eventually fail me, and frankly the idea of living to 90 is a good bit longer than I would give myself anyway. But my intelligence is a big part of my identity and it would terrify me to lose it even if I was perfectly fit. What good is a sound body when there is no sound mind to guide it?"
"R_1mOCKbwtLZTxsWm","religious","I'm not religious; I consider myself to be an agnostic. I have seen too much contradiction and hypocrisy in the worlds' religions and too little evidence of truth to believe that any one of them is the 'right' way. I don't dismiss the possibility of an unknowable entity greater than ourselves, I just don't think it needs to be defined by ritual worship and prescriptive rules of behavior that are designed more to rule and exploit people than lead them to enlightenment."
"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","friend_value","I value honesty, because if I can't trust you there is no reason to continue spending time together. I am a firm believer in trusting your friends with everything. I wouldn't lie to a friend so I would want the same treatment."
"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do recently was giving their Halloween candy to  other children when the candy dish ran out. The child was very upset when kids came to the door and there wasn't anything to pass out. She decided on her own to pass her own treats out. "

"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up would be the old Kodak buildings. They have long been abandoned but seeing what old reminders of what the city used to be like is quite disturbing. It gives people a sense of loss when looking at those buildings. "
"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","fire_rescue","I would save my families photo albums. Materialistic items can always be purchased again, but having photos of family who have long been deceased can't be replaced. I would be happy with pictures of memories with family. "
"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","mind_body","I would choose the mind of a 30 year old. In my opinion what good is an active body if your mind can't keep up with it. I would also think an alert mind would allow me to make choices to become more healthy with my body. "
"R_1NkNaNFUOBrM85r","religious","I am a religious person. I was brought up and raised inside church and it became natural part of my life. As I got older I always maintained my relationship with church and I've enjoyed my experiences inside my religion. "

"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","friend_value","I value trust in a friendship more than anything. Trust covers a wide variety of things, but in essence when I trust a friend I know they will not share things I tell them with others without asking me first; I know they will also trust me, and give me the benefit of the doubt; I know they will try to understand me rather than judge me."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","mind_body","Definitely the mind. Having a young body is useless without a sharp mind, but an aged body with a sharp mind can still contribute a lot to society. Also, I have a deep fear of losing my mental faculties to things like Alzheimer's."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","cute_baby","I cannot think of anything offhand.  Babies and children are inherently cute, and I generally only remember the fact that I find them cute rather than details.  It's probably when they smile and laugh--a laugh that involves full body wiggles--that I find them the cutest."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","strangest","I think the strangest thing about my neighborhood was how normal it was. I have come to realize that most neighborhoods have geographical quirks, and eccentric people, or its own bad elements. My neighborhood could easily have been featured in an upbeat after-school TV movie."

I like that it provides me at least some personal income to cover a few of my essential needs and--very occasionally--my wants.  It is mostly work outside my areas of interest, so I have been able to learn things I hadn't considered important to me in the past."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","how_raised","I grew up poor, due to both of my parents having moderately severe health problems.  If I could change that, I would have chosen to grow up at least lower middle class, if not high middle class.  I have my own health problems and I believe it would have been easier to deal with them without adequate resources."

Almost everything else could be replaced, given time, but much of that data is irreplaceable and non-reproducible."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","last_sing","I don't remember the last time I sang to myself. The last time I sang to someone else was more than a decade ago.  I sang ""You Are My Sunshine"" to my then girlfriend.  I am not comfortable singing around anybody, or even just to myself. I don't even sing along to music when I'm alone."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","garden","I don't care to garden or do yard work. Growing up we had a walnut tree in our front yard and a cherry tree in the back yard.  I enjoyed the cherries but I quickly developed a sensitivity to the walnuts. I did not enjoy the amount of work they involved, and I definitely prefer other pursuits for my hobbies and spare time."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","religious","I was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Both of my parents were also raised in my church. I have had my periods of doubts and have become more distant from my faith than anybody in my immediate family, but in my heart I still believe the LDS faith is the most correct."
"R_1OPtBzlx3P4aWhT","why_studies","Mostly I do them for income. I am disabled and I cannot hold any kind of regular employment. I must have work that is extremely flexible in how, when, and how much I do it.  Unfortunately, while MTurk does not pay reasonably, it's the only option I have right now, and it's far better than nothing. Online studies are at least half of the work I do on MTurk, especially since I cannot take on most of the longer duration HITs."

"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","famous","Ideally, I would like to have the financial opportunities that often come with being famous but I wouldn't want the fame.  It is hard to be in the spotlight where everyone is analyzing every single second of your life.  Every word and every picture is dissected by the public.  That is far too much for me. "
"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","mind_body","I would rather retain the mind of a 30-year-old as opposed to the body of a 30-year-old.  One thing that scares me about getting older is losing my independence.  I have family members who suffer from dementia and Alzheimer's.  They have been dependent on my family members for the last 10 years.  They cannot take care of themselves and require care around the clock.  If I had the mind of a 30-year-old when I was 90, perhaps I could maintain my independence for as long as possible.  I understand that other health conditions may arise from having a 90-year-old body, but I would rather face those conditions as opposed to potentially experiencing dementia.  "
"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","friend_value","I value loyalty.  I keep my circle of friends small because it is hard to find people that I trust.  Without loyalty, friendships are very hard to maintain.  I have known my current best friends for over 10 years. "

I actually have an emergency kit ready for situations such as a house fire and my diabetic supplies are in that emergency kit.  "

"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","religious","I am not a religious person.  I used to be a very dedicated Christian when I was younger, but I no longer believe in Christianity or any religion.  When I was in my early 20's, I started to question the beliefs of Christianity and other religion.  Once I did that, my religious foundation fell apart.  Before that point, I had never really questioned my religious beliefs.  I started questioning the feasibility of events of the Bible and other religions.  This led me to doubting other parts of the church."
"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","cute_baby","My niece is 6 years old.  She has been attending school and recently received her report card.  She did well in all of her subjects.  Much of that is due to my mother tutoring her and making sure she does her homework.  Once my niece found out her grades, she called up my mom and thanked her for being the ""best grandma in the world"" for helping her with her studies.    "

There can be downtime through the day where absolutely nothing is happening.  This can be nice at times because I will work on other things.  However, it can be very boring.  When everything is working as it should, you have days where no one will bother you.  If a major system goes down, you could have dozens of calls to respond to every hour.  "
"R_1OwaxFGSPivw8vc","how_raised","I wish I was taught to question things more.  I grew up in a very strict family.  My parents often didn't tell me why to do something.  They just told me to do it.  I believe deducing why and how something occurs is a vital skill for everyone, of all ages, to have.  I started to really gain this skill in my 20s.  I definitely didn't have this when I was still living with my parents."

It's strange to see how that industry has completely died after all these years, and left the economy in ruins as well as the lives that depended on it.

"R_1Pb0ZYOuoiyOJep","how_raised","Hmm, I would probably change how lax my parents were about goals. For a good amount of my life, I simply wandered without any goals in mind and that really set me behind my peers. I'm still young so I'm glad I figured it out now rather than in my 40s at least. "
"R_1Pb0ZYOuoiyOJep","strangest","That's a really good question honestly... If I had to say I guess it'd be how poor the area was. The house I grew up in was literally falling apart. Some of the other houses in the neighborhood was also in a similar state of disrepair. "

"R_1PbZVt4opeTwviI","like_work","I work in commercial construction.  I consider myself lucky, in that my company has come to accept me as their 'all purpose' guy.  As such, I get to fill in for people who can't work for whatever reason on any given day.  This lets me experience many different disciplines, and makes the job much more interesting for me than doing the same thing every day."
"R_1PbZVt4opeTwviI","cute_baby","Oh gosh, I'll have to think about that one a minute.  I'm afraid I'm not particularly fond of babies or young children.  Is it okay to mention a baby I didn't actually see in person?  A friend of mine has a photograph of a mountainous set of steps leading up to a large government-looking building.  There are no other people in the photo, but in the middle of the vast set of steps is a baby crawling up them.  I find that pretty amusing."

I'm not sure if I'd ever get involved with something like that personally, but I do get a kick out of it sometimes.  How many people who live in urban areas can actually say that they've pulled a carrot out of the ground and eaten it?!"
"R_1PbZVt4opeTwviI","strangest","That's easy.  I grew up in New York City, so almost by definition the strangest thing is that NOTHING was strange.  In that sort of chaotic urban environment, you're going to see everything and anything imaginable at some point.  Eventually, nothing really surprises you anymore.  It's not that you become totally immune to unusual events, but they probably don't seem quite as unusual as they would to someone from elsewhere."

To me, what friends actually do together isn't as important as what they might theoretically do together or 'for' each other.  In other words, what really matters is knowing that you have someone you can count on in any situation.  "
"R_1PbZVt4opeTwviI","how_raised","I suppose I'd prefer to have had the classic 'happy home', rather than a situation where my parents divorced when I was pretty young.  It's not that there was a lot of fighting, or anything like that.  The whole situation appeared pretty amicable to me, whether it actually was or not.  Still, I can't help thinking that it probably made me a little more cynical about marriage than I might otherwise be. "
"R_1PbZVt4opeTwviI","religious","That's a hard one to answer.  I suppose I am, in my own way.  If I were asked that sort of question in a survey, I'd probably take the 'spiritual, but not religious' option if it were available.  I don't belong to any formal organized religious group, but I can't help feeling that there are a lot of pretty miraculous things going on in the universe."

I would for sure grab my back up drive to my pc because it contains digital copies of all my pictures, copies of old tax returns and other documents that would be impossible or difficult to replace.  But the saved pictures of my children, parents, grand and great parents would be the most valuable thing for sure."

I do have a couple of apple trees I planted and that have been bearing fruit for the past five years.  They are small but always bear more than I can eat at once and I don't freeze or can them so most of them got to waste. I like the idea of having them though and they aren't much work."
"R_1PepiIgHv7Fsxi4","friend_value","I am not sure how to answer.  Do you mean what do I get most out of it or what about a friendship is most important.  The most important thing to me is just knowing there is someone who cares and wants to listen to you whether it be talking about a problem you are having or your take on some situation.  They listen non-judgmentally and then give their own take on your thoughts."
"R_1PepiIgHv7Fsxi4","why_studies","I definitely do them primarily for the extra income they bring in.  They are good for paying for birthdays, Christmas and a vacation every year.  I do enjoy some of the studies but the vast majority are tedious, repetitious and I suspect a waste of time as well.  If they actually accomplish something that is just a side bonus to the money."

I think in the end I would chose having the mind of a 30 year old.  I can deal with an aging body and I think that until you get close to 70 you can accept your physically aging body and still live a normal life.

I would sing Barney songs to her at night to help get her to sleep."

I would like to have been pushed into more social activities and spent a lot more time around people to overcome my natural shyness.  Unfortunately my parents are much like me and don't seek out a lot of social situations and are very shy themselves so they sort of reinforced my own natural tendencies."
"R_1PepiIgHv7Fsxi4","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous in the way that a celebrity like a movie star is.  I wouldn't mind being know because I have been very successful at something such as a scientific discovery, solving a math problem or something similar.

When I was younger I would sometimes do religious things like go to church but I think I was just pleasing my grandfather who was a preacher but I am not sure I ever had any real belief.  As I have gotten older it has just been very clear that religion is totally illogical and contradicted by the laws of the universe that it is clear that they are more a philosophical than real construct."

I am not sure I recall anything too strange but when we lived in South Carolina it was a new experience to me have so many African Americans in my school.

"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","strangest","The fact that so many people stay there. It's a small town in the northeast and there's not much to do. It's hot and muggy in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. I'd like to be somewhere else that's better weather wise and that has more things to do."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","fire_rescue","I would save my acoustic guitar. I have had it for a long time. It has a lot of sentimental value to me. It's gotten me through some hard times and it has a lot of memories attached to it."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","how_raised","Maybe a little bit more structure. Having someone push me a little bit more. I lived with my mother growing up and she was really laid back and relaxed. I liked it because I could experience things others didn't but I also wasn't pushed to try my hardest in certain aspects."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","religious","I am not religious. I never have been. It's just not something that I believe in and it doesn't appeal to me. I am more into scientific explanations of why we are here and what happens in the world."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","mind_body","That's so difficult. I feel I am smart so the mind would be nice. But I think I would go with the body. I think my mind would last quite a while but I'd like to not deal with my body gradually breaking down and not being able to do things that I used to be able to do."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","why_studies","Most of the time, it's for money. Sometimes it's if I'm bored. But lately I've had a bit of a hard time financially and every little bit of extra money I get comes in handy."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","famous","I'd more like to be respected. I play music and would like to be able to make money from touring and recording. I wouldn't want to be super famous where people would bother me all the time but I would like some level of recognition from people who liked my music and wanted to see me perform."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","cute_baby","Definitely dancing. My friend Jim has a young girl named Payton. She does this dance every time she sees certain people. It is the cutest thing I've ever seen."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","like_work","I do drilling and blasting. It's basically blowing up rock with high explosives. I like it because it's physical and also a little bit dangerous."
"R_1qa0DmWyr0ps4ns","friend_value","Companionship. Being able to have someone around to laugh with or to share things with. I have a lot of acquaintances but few close friends. My close friends are here for life and it's because I value their companionship."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","last_sing","I last sang to myself earlier in the car. The song that was playing was ""Margaritaville"" and I sang along. I don't think I've ever sang to another person, except maybe my son when he was an infant, 17 years ago."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen was the other day when I was visiting my son's 4-year-old half sister. I told her I had to go home and she became upset. She told me, ""But I neeeeeed you."" It was the cutest thing ever."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","fire_rescue","I would save my jewelry box. First of all, there are expensive items in it. More importantly, there are sentimental items in it that I inherited from my grandmother."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","garden","I do not have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden. I live in an apartment so a garden is out of the question. I did have some houseplants, but they aggravated my allergies and caused me to get laryngitis so I had to get rid of them."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I'd say I'd have liked to have had more freedom. My parents were very overprotective. I feel that it left me unprepared for living on my own once I got older and got out into the world."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","why_studies","I do online studies primarily for the extra cash. And do them to pass time, as I get very bored being on disability and not being able to work a traditional job. Also, I find them interesting at times."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","mind_body","This is a very hard question. I think I'd prefer to keep my mind intact over my body. I'd rather be of sound mind and be able to continue my important relationships with my friends and family."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is, to me, the lack of diversity. Nearly everyone in my hometown is Italian and Roman Catholic. Minorities and people of other religions were few and far between."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","religious","I am not a religious person. I was brought up Roman Catholic, but I don't really believe in any of their teachings. If I had to say what I am now, I'd call myself agnostic."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","like_work","I don't work. I've been disabled since the age of 17. I did work some after that, but I had to quit when I became pregnant with my son at age 26. "
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","famous","I don't think I'd like to be famous. I'd certainly enjoy the financial aspect of it, but having no privacy would be a drag. If I had to be famous, I'd want it to be for something positive I've contributed to the world."
"R_1QbwKqi6sjuToCR","friend_value","The things I value most in a friendship are loyalty, honesty, and kindness. I can't tolerate liars and cruel people. And I can't stand someone whose loyalties shift."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","cute_baby","When babies giggle I think it is adorable.  I used to play pee-a-boo with my son and he would just crack up laughing.  They have the cutest little giggle compared to an older child or adult."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","friend_value","I value honesty and trust.  I want to know that if I talk to you, that I can trust that you will keep it to yourself and not tell everyone.  I value someone who is fun to be around and not afraid to be themselves."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","like_work","I am an Administrative Assistant.  I like interacting with the public and interoffice staff.  It seems like almost every day I learn something new.  It's always a learning experience and you never know what is going to happen from day to day.  I do a lot of scheduling and trying to keep the schedules balanced for 5 different people.."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","strangest","I grew up in the outer area of the city.  But we still had a patch of woods and a creek behind the apartments that we lived in.  So it was like we were in the city one minute and in the country the next."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","famous","I would love to be famous as far as what nice things I have done for people in need.  If I was rich, I would certainly be famous for my giving ways.  I want to be remembered as someone important down the road.  "
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","last_sing","I actually sang to myself this morning.  Heard a song (Tina Turner-Better be Good to Me) and was singing along.  I just sang to my husband a couple of weeks ago, as we were dancing.  We actually were singing parts of a song together (Free-by Zac Brown Band)."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","why_studies","I enjoy these studies because I learn new stuff.  I also get to learn stuff about me at times.  Also, on occasion, I get to see a new product or product idea, which I find very interesting.  Also, on occasion, I get to interact with others."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","garden","I have some flowers.  I am not sure what kind they are though.  They were a gift.  I do not have a garden.  Although, I attempted to grow tomatoes last year with not much success.  "
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind.  The body doesn't matter if the mind isn't there.  I would still want to think for myself."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","religious","I believe in God because that is how I was raised.  However, I do not attend religious services and am not heavily religious.  I do pray on occasion, but not regularly."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","fire_rescue","It would be the urns that contain my mother and fathers ashes.  I just recently lost my mother and I lost my father two years ago.  That probably sounds weird but it gives me comfort to have them."
"R_1QuqCvZX9GqXDYd","how_raised","It would be that I would have been taught to be more confident about myself.  I always tend to kind be kind of shy when meeting someone at first.  I seem to do better when there is more than just one person besides me around so that I am not the ""center of attention"", so to speak.  I am not sure why I am that way but I feel that it was in my upbringing."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","why_studies","I mostly do these for the extra money.  When I have the downtime, I look for ways to save money and find extra sources of income to pay off my credit cards and car loan.  It doesn't contribute much to my income, but something is better than nothing."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","mind_body","That's a hard question to answer, but I assume this means that my mind would be aging normally but my body would stay the same age. I think I would prefer to have the younger body. My mind wouldn't start to age until I was close to age 90 anyways, but my body will give out before then.  I'd like to be able to continue to travel, hike, and enjoy life without being limited by mobility.  I work with several people in their 70s who are still some of the brightest minds in the country."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","friend_value","I think that honesty and a good listener are the qualities I value the most in a friendship. I need a friend that isn't scared to tell me the truth, regardless of the consequences of their actions. I also need a friend who will be there when I need someone their help and guidance, without question."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","strangest","That's a difficult question as I didn't grow up in any one specific place.  My family was military so I have moved around a lot.  But I did spent the majority of my life in the south, where people are extremely judgmental and self-centered, which seems very strange and foreign from my own world view."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","fire_rescue","My first instinct would be to grab my phone so that I could save my photos and make sure that my family and friends know that I'm okay. There's not too many things I own that have monetary or sentimental value worth putting my life at risk for.  The only thing close to that would be one of my guitars, which I spent a considerable amount on."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","last_sing","I don't think I ever ""sing"" to anyone else.  I often sing/butcher songs when I'm in the car with other people though, so I guess that might count.  I don't think I really ever sing outside of the car."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","how_raised","I was raised in a very poor environment where my mom was forced to work three jobs to provide for her and myself. This is definitely something I wish I could change.  She had to sacrifice twenty years of her life to raise me, and I wish I could change that for her."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","like_work","I work as a project manager from cancer clinical trials.  It's very fulfilling to be a part of an effort that benefits people and helps to saves lives. This was the job I had in mind when I was in grad school, and to be able to have achieved it so young makes me feel very accomplished."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","famous","If I were to be famous, I would want to be famous as an artist/musician or for doing something that advances human rights or environmental concerns.  I don't enjoy the celebrity culture and our society's obsession with it. I would enjoy the notoriety of being the best at what I do, but not in a celebrity sort of way."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","religious","I am not a religious person.  I grew up and went to school in a science background, which teaches people to believe things for which there is tangible evidence and to change your views in light of new evidence.  I don't feel like these ideals can be balanced with the faith that religion requires."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","cute_baby","That's a hard question, I tend to find children more obnoxious and annoying than cute.  But I do find it cute when children do things that demonstrate how much they care about animals. I love to see a small child cuddling or sleeping with dogs or cats."
"R_1qVYRCEbhSedHrK","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or gardens.  My roommates maintain a small garden in our backyard that has several different types of herbs that we grow for personal use. I do not think I would particularly enjoy the act of maintaining a garden."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","why_studies","I like to have a little fun money for myself. I made good money, but most of my paycheck goes toward livings and savings, which makes it hard for me to justify spending money on myself. So I use study money to splurge on fun things like perfume or clothes."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","religious","I am not. For no other reason that I don't believe in God. I've never felt that presence in my life, nor have I found or seen any evidence to believe otherwise."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","mind_body","The mind, for sure! I don't place much emphasis on looks, so I don't really mind the idea of aging. But losing my mental capabilities frightens me."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","last_sing","I don't ever sing in front of others! But I do sing all the time when I'm alone. The last time I sang was while doing dishes this morning. "
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","how_raised","Oh man, I would change a lot. I had a fairly unhappy child and young adulthood because I wasn't lucky enough to have a caring and supportive family. So I would probably change who I was raised by, if that was ever possible."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","garden","I have houseplants and a garden! I love plants, and I find I need to have them around to be calm and content. I just got into outdoor vegetable gardening this year, and I took to it quite quickly! I love to get outside and work in the dirt."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","friend_value","Kindness and humor, I think. I can't imagine being friends with someone who isn't a fundamentally kind person. Also I really love to laugh, so I strive to fill my social circle with people who have a great sense of humor. "
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","cute_baby","I don't know that I can really recall anything in particular. I don't really like kids or babies, and I don't spend much time around them. I was the youngest in my family growing up, and I don't have friends or family members with young children."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","fire_rescue","I have a big aloe plant that I love. Not only because it is a lovely plant, but because of the memories and feelings associated with it. It reminds me of when my partner and I just moved in together---it was one of the first things we bought for our apartment. I'd be very sad if it was destroyed. "
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","like_work","I work in healthcare technology. I like being a part of something that helps people, even if I'm not interacting with people directly. It can be difficult and tedious at times, but I find it rewarding."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","strangest","The income/standard of living gap. Though I guess that's more sad than strange. I technically grew up in a very wealthy city, but in a low-income part of that city filled with lower blue collar folks and immigrants. But if you went into the city there were high-end shops, mansions by the beach, and other obvious signs of wealth."
"R_1QxCWP2ofs6q1fb","famous","Absolutely not. Not at all. I'm very private and I greatly dislike attention. Being famous is basically my worst nightmare."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","why_studies","It's how I stay home with my kids! I couldn't afford to lose income entirely, but if I can spend some free time on my computer and work hard and earn just enough to pay my bills, I'm happy. I lose a lot of sleep and it's a struggle some days, but I love that I don't have to ship my kids off to daycare and that I can homeschool. It's a good thing I enjoy being poor!"
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","how_raised","I wish my Mom wouldn't have spend so much time on herself. She was going to bars and searching for a boyfriend and trying to make her life complete. It didn't work out, and now she's wanting more and more time with me. I wish she would have enjoyed my presence THEN, when I worshiped her, and not now when I have my own kids and life."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","strangest","I think my childhood was pretty normal, really. I guess my Dad leaving my mom and going through several step parents was unusual. He ended up marrying a woman from New Zealand who was only 9 years older than me, and moving there. So, I guess that's pretty strange."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","garden","Yeah we have a small garden. We plant tomatoes, zucchini, peppers, beans, cucumbers. Definitely won't do cucumbers again, though. One plant makes way too many for us!"
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","religious","I like to say I'm spiritual. I totally connect with a higher power, but I see that higher power being nature and not a ""God"" so to speak. I was raised protestant, so I understand Christianity, I just see them as stories to teach morals. You can also teach morals without the threat of hell and damnation."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","famous","Oh no, definitely not! I wouldn't want to be famous. I don't need any kind of fame or fortune. That sounds like way too much work. I'm definitely a happy, poor hermit!"
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","cute_baby","My kids are pretty adorable. Even when they're being stubborn or naughty, I'd say they're the cutest kids ever. It makes disciplining them difficult!"
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","mind_body","Definitely the mind. I could still teach people and write memoirs and interact online from a hospital bed. But my body does no good if my mind isn't there to control it."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","fire_rescue","I would probably save my computer or my harddrive because it has all of the pictures from my kids on it. I have a lot of things with sentimental value, but those pictures can't be taken again and very few of them are backed up online. I already lost my son's earliest pictures when my phone broke, and I know how it feels to miss those moments."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","friend_value","I really enjoy friends that I can be myself. Who don't judge me if I need to cancel plans, as long as I'm honest with them. Who I can admit to being unsure or confident and don't have to put on a show. I want to be myself around them."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","like_work","Well I have an education degree and I homeschool my son, so I tell people I'm a teacher. But generally my work on Mturk is my income, and that's hard to explain to people, so I'll say I do crowdsourcing work for Amazon. I also buy and sell things online, occasionally."
"R_1rdJbywCYtRQXXG","last_sing","Oh I talk to myself a lot, but I generally only sing to the kids. And usually it's either being silly, or singing along to a show to try and get their attention. I was in choir as a kid, does that count?"
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","how_raised","Honestly, I don't think I would change anything. Although there were ups and downs like any upbringing, I feel like it's shaped me into the person I am, and I'm super appreciative of that. If I had to choose one thing, I would say I wish I was pushed a little bit more, I guess? I think that I was challenged, but mostly in sports and competition. If I had been more challenged in school or had more idea of how to become a professional, that would have helped me."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","garden","No, we currently don't have any fruit trees or a garden. The apartment we rent is pretty small, so it's difficult for us to have any of these. However, there is some space outside in the small yard where there are a few trees and native plants, some of which are pretty cool-looking."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the small-town feel of everything. The people there seemed to know the business of everyone in town, no matter what. Rumors flew around and spread like wildfire. Parents were always commenting and were snarky when talking about other families, it was kind of odd."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","famous","I don't think I would really like to be famous. I would like the wealth that comes with it, but it depends what kind of famous you're talking about. To be a movie star, or something like that, would be something I'd probably avoid. I don't love attention, and being followed by people, paparazzi, people always looking for pictures, etc seems awful. If it were something like a scientific discovery then I would love that. That way there'd be less hoopla. "
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","religious","No, I'm not a religious person at all. I was raised as a Catholic, but once I became of an age where I really started to understand things, the people around me, and the world around me, I decided to not follow through with my raised religion. I'm more of a science person who feels as though religion is often a dividing force, which I don't like. I'm basically agnostic now because of this."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","like_work","I work at a hospital in a research lab. I really like the fact that I get to use my brain all the time. I'm constantly challenged to think critically and innovate. I feel like I'm surrounded by smart people and feel that I'm really making a difference in the world with my work."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was probably yesterday in the shower. Sometimes I get songs stuck in my head and I'll hum or sing them when alone. It seems to come up most when I'm in the shower. Singing in front of other people is another story. I have a poor singing voice, so it was probably at a karaoke bar a few years back after some drinks."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","mind_body","I think I would probably go with my mind. I have fears of losing my grip on reality and my wherewithal. I have seen the catastrophic and sad effects that dementia and loss of sense in old age, and I'd like to avoid that. I feel like I could maintain my body as long as I was of sound mind. Obviously, it wouldn't be like a 30 year old, but I could prevent injury with exercise and all that."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","friend_value","I value loyalty most in a friendship. I like when I have someone who I can confide in, talk to, enjoy their company, and have a good time. Having someone who is loyal, will help you when you're feeling down is the best thing. Sometimes you just need someone to show that they care for you. That's what makes for good friends, people who are unselfish and know when and how to be there for you."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","cute_baby","I think the cutest thing I've ever seen a child do was be loving towards a sibling. There are many times where friends of mine with small children have had the kids together. It always makes me smile and amazes me when they hug or snuggle with each other. This even happens with their pets too, it's extra cute."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","fire_rescue","If my house was on fire, I'd probably go with saving my golf clubs. If they're in the house, they're probably the thing that I own that's actually portable in that situation which has a lot of value. I'd just go for something that is worth the most, and I don't have too many things worth a lot of money."
"R_1rDrGhn0yZwkvkm","why_studies","I do online studies for a few different reasons. For one, it's a nice way to get a couple extra dollars for discretionary spending. Also, as someone who's interested in science, I like contributing to studies. Anything that furthers knowledge and can help out in understanding the world around us is good incentive for me to take part in surveys and studies."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","why_studies","I do online studies for a couple of reasons. For one, I'm bored at work, and they give me something to fill the time with. Two, they give me a way to make a little extra money on the side. I'm saving up for a trip to Ireland, and every little bit helps."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","how_raised","I wish my father hadn't died when I was four. I wish that I could have known him growing up. My childhood was good, but that is one thing I wish could have been different."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","fire_rescue","That is a hard question. I suppose that I would grab my birthstone ring. It's sentimental to me because my mom gave it to me. My main concern would be my family and pets, though, so realistically I don't know if I would be thinking about my possessions."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","strangest","I grew up with a lot of animals in a rural area. We had chickens, goats, cats, and dogs. We even had a couple of turkeys. That would probably be the strangest thing about it."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","mind_body","That's too hard to answer. Your body is no good without a mind, but your mind is no good without your body. I would probably say mind, if I had to pick. It's easy to escape into your mind, even if you can't escape with your body."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","last_sing","I've never sung to anyone else. I don't want their ears to bleed! I suppose the last time I sung to myself would be in the car on my commute a couple of weeks ago."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","garden","I have a veggie garden every summer. Most things don't grow very well, but I do get a good number of banana peppers. Our tomatoes always get worms, though. We had a good crop of sweet potatoes this year."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","friend_value","I value honesty in a friendship. I don't want to feel like someone is being fake with me or that I need to be fake with them. Open communication is key for me. I also value loyalty. "
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","religious","Yes, I am a religious person. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died to redeem us of our sins. I believe that because I know in my heart that it's true, and I've experienced what it is like to have a relationship with God."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","cute_baby","I don't really like babies or children. So I can't think of anything really truly cute that I've seen them do. I avoid them."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","famous","No, I wouldn't want to be famous. The only good thing about fame would be the money that would come with it. But I wouldn't want to be under a microscope like famous people are. That would be far too stressful."
"R_1rPtvqcVEHLfQEm","like_work","I'm an administrative assistant at a large university. I basically support several higher-up administrators. I don't really like my job. The only thing I do like is my coworkers. Most of them, anyway."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","why_studies","There are multiple reasons I do the survey. One reason would be the extra cash I make by doing them. The other is I am curious about research and what or why something is being studied. Sometimes they are obvious other times they are not."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","fire_rescue","Back in the day I'd probably of said photos but those are all online now. So I'd have to say my kitchen aid mixers. Everyone knows how much I love to bake."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is there was a bar on every corner. There were bars in the town before there was a grocery store, gas station or a bank. The main intersection had five bars."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","friend_value","I value another persons honesty. Their willingness to take time out of their schedule to spend with me or listen to me. Short answer would be companionship."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","like_work","I am a scheduling manager. I like the variety that comes with the job. Everyday is different."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","mind_body","I would said I'd prefer the body of the 30 year old. What good does he mind do if you can't get up and move or do things for yourself? I'd like the knowledge of the 90 year old."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","religious","I am not just religious, I am also spiritual. In part because of how I was raised. But also because I questioned some of the teachings of the church."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","how_raised","I wouldn't change anything about the way I was raised. I would have liked for my mom to be home more because she worked a lot of hours. But I was surrounded by the rest of the family."
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","last_sing","I sing every time I am in the car. My singing is horrible. In the car I can crank the tunes so no one else can hear me. "
"R_20NGxV5KOxo5I3J","famous","I have no interest in being famous. I am good with just doing my thing. Whatever that may be at the moment and not having a bunch of people in my business."

"R_20Zh1w7b4G54pzq","mind_body","I would want the mind of a 30 year old. I wouldn't mind being old and slow. But I do not want to lose who I am. Not being able to remember friends and family and all the things I did with my beautiful wife would be so sad. "
"R_20Zh1w7b4G54pzq","religious","I currently am not. The church did not agree with a few choices I made and kicked me out. They also told my family to not talk to me. Which is what turned me off from church for a bit."

"R_21ozCBADPEkX0jm","mind_body","The body of a 30 year old because I wouldn’t have any physical impairments to see the world. I would keep an older mind because it probably has wisdom and experience. An old mind and a young body is the best of both worlds."
"R_21ozCBADPEkX0jm","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is definitely how different it is from where I live now. We used to play on the streets and everyone knew each other. I would play and walk outside without fear of anything."

I currently have a grape vine named Eve that has been with me through A LOT, an olive tree I recently got as a birthday present, and I just planted calendula, poppies, holy basil, and white sage- all of which are sprouting!"
"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","last_sing","Oh man, I sing random jingles to myself all the time. I was singing this morning, wondering where my pants were. ""Where the fuck are my paaaaants?"" I think that's how it went. I sang a podcast theme song to my mom the other day, to convince her to listen to it. It's silly and catchy and it's always stuck in my head."
"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","why_studies","I don't do them for fun, that's for damn sure. I do them to make money while I'm looking for a more permanent, stable job. MTurk doesn't pay well and it can be incredibly disheartening, but it's something."

There are a ton of Mexican immigrants, too, and we certainly have a fair amount of poverty as well. It's probably pretty different here than one who's never visited would think."

The first year he did this, there were these kids that were just straight-up concerned about the belly-ache their mother would eventually get and I think about it all the time. I want my future kids to be just like them- not really caring about the candy, but worrying about their mother. It's the cutest thing."

"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","how_raised","I would have liked to be raised with a father that loved me. For so long, I really thought having a positive male figure wasn't that big of a deal, but I've realized a lot of things about myself lately. I've been able to recognize how not having a father has affected me negatively, and it's really tough to break out of that. "
"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","religious","I always say I'm spiritual, not religious. I find organized religion to be kind of nuts, as I cannot imagine having that much blind faith in anything, much less a sky god that may or may not be actually real. I do, however, find it fascinating to learn about different religions and belief systems. Personally, I believe in the magic of the Universe and Mother Nature."
"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","famous","Hell no, I would not like to be famous. I'm pretty damn introverted and do not like an excessive amount of attention.I can't imagine having everything you do constantly scrutinized by the public, especially now with social media- everyone's so mean! I would, however, like to be influential. I like when people like me (who doesn't?) and I like when my recommendations and ideas are taken seriously."

I also like being able to access information whenever I want. There's so much you can do on an iPad- creativity-wise, business-wise, etc. I'm never bored and I think that's important."
"R_21zvCeWG7ccsFdj","friend_value","I value optimism, open-mindedness, loyalty, and humor the most. These days, it can be hard to retain good friendships. Everything's become so political and harsh, but I'm not one to say that's a bad thing. Of course I can be pleasant with everyone, but good friendships are rare and I don't feel the need to be the most popular. I just want people who share my views about the most important things close to me."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","mind_body","I can see arguments each way.  I've watched the health of my parents slowly decline over the years, and they have quite a ways to go to reach 90.  But for me this is easy.  The mind.  Being able to think quickly and clearly.  Being able to understand new things easily.  These are invaluable to me.  I've always preferred mental activities to physical ones so there really is no decision to make for me."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","cute_baby","Oh, now you know I hate children.  I kid, slightly.  But really I want nothing to do with babies and feel awkward around kids.  I honestly can't think of an answer here, ""cute"" is not a word I'd use to describe babies or children."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","famous","I would never want to be famous; not in any way at all.  You know I really don't like attention, especially public attention.  When I see things about celebrities, I see all the photographers and attention and think how horrible it must be.  Never to be able to do things without being recognized and bothered.  I couldn't even be anonymous shopping for groceries.  Now being known and respected by a group of peers would be fine, but fame?  No."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","religious","I went to church as a child, or rather was dragged to church as a child.  But since I've been on my own I haven't set foot in a church.  My background is in science as you know.  I like evidence.  I simply cannot take things on faith, and that is basically what religion is: taking some rather implausible things on faith.  Now I'm not entirely anti-religion.  The Bible has many valuables lessons and if it helps people lead a better life, that is great.  Just as long as they leave me out of it.  I get along just fine without religion."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","garden","There is a small border of bushes in front of the house, and that is all.  I have no tolerance for weeding and such.  I like grass.  Grass is easy to take care of.  But I feel obliged to make the front look a bit better for the neighbors, so I have a row of bushes in front of the house -- carefully selected to require the absolute minimum in care."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","strangest","Well I grew up in a number of places, my father's job caused us to move several times.  We lived for several years back in elementary school in a small village.  It was very rural and the school was so small it had only two or three classes -- there weren't even enough students for one class per grade!"
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","like_work","I deliver pizzas for a living.  I could go on and on about the things I don't like about it of course.  The biggest thing though is that it isn't a job I take home with me.  I don't mean that I don't have ""homework"" or have to handle phone calls from the boss after hours, although that is true.  I mean I simply don't even think about my job when I'm not working.  I can focus my energies on things I find valuable."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","friend_value","I think mostly just having someone with similar beliefs and interests to myself.  I am interested in some unusual things as you know and if talk about them with most people I get blank stares in response.  I'm just not into the same things most people are.  I like being able to discuss my hobbies (and yours!) with you and have an intelligent conversation about them."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","fire_rescue","Without a doubt I'd grab my computer.  It feels like most of my life is on my computer: my photos, the programs I've written, games and much more.  I have things on it going back over 30 years!  It's not really the value of the computer, insurance would cover that, it is the data on it that cannot replaced."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","last_sing","I was singing along with a song on the radio in my car just last night.  Quietly of course: you know I can't sing and I wouldn't want to mess up what I was listening to.  When did I last sing to someone else?  Never, really.  Not person to person.  The only times I've sung in public have been in a large group -- back in school for example.  And even then, done quietly."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","why_studies","I do the online studies primarily to make money of course.  Some of them are interesting though and can make you think, which is a bonus.  But without the money I wouldn't bother with any of them."
"R_22JlRDRglP5rPIE","how_raised","For the most part I'm quite happy with the way I was raised.  But I suppose I found my parents -- or really my mother -- to be a bit overly restrictive.  Compared to my friends I was never able to go out and play as much, or stay out late, things like that.  I suppose that was due to her rather strict upbringing, but it was frustrating at time."
"R_22Kq65H37VmsWO6","last_sing","Honestly, I can't remember the last time I sang to myself.  It would probably have been in the shower or in a car ride home.   It would probably have been a Tom Petty song to myself on a car ride home."

Churches and other religious gatherings felt odd to me, since it wasn't what I grew up with. I got curious and read most of the important religious texts in my teens but more than anything that convinced me that it's more important to live by sound moral principles than to have a prescribed set of beliefs. That said, I do at times envy the strength that some people can take from their faith and have seen it get many people through hard times."

"R_23fMX0sscOweSHF","strangest","I found it strange that there was very little adult supervision in my childhood neighborhood. My cousins and I would walk blocks to the store and play outside till nighttime when we were under 10 years old. I grew up in the city, and there was a large amount of violence and other crimes, including crimes against children, so it was not safe."
"R_23fMX0sscOweSHF","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants, nor a garden. I unfortunately don't have a ""green thumb"" and would probably destroy them before they fully matured. I would love to one day learn how to care for trees and plants, maybe when I retire it is something I will try. "
"R_23fMX0sscOweSHF","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby or child do is attempt to emulate their parent by taking care of their younger sibling. I think it is wonderful that a child loves their younger sibling and cares about their well being. I think it is cute when a child attempts to feed their younger sibling, change their pamper and comfort them when they are upset. "
"R_23fMX0sscOweSHF","why_studies","I like to do online studies because they are fun, profitable, and I learn from them. I also see many studies are from individuals trying to complete their programs or courses in college. I have an undergraduate degree and know the programs and courses are tough and require hard work, so I'm glad to help them achieve their goals. "
"R_23fMX0sscOweSHF","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised it would be the area and conditions I lived in. I was raised by my grandmother and great grandmother in a house that should have been condemned. There was a large amount of rodents and the ceiling was falling in. Although it appeared to once be a beautiful home my mother and aunt's should have forced my grand parents to leave this house, it was not safe for us there. "

So he got his little step stool and went back out... still couldn't get it. He told me that he needed a ice giggle and he needed my help. "
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","religious","I think of god as the operator. In fact that is what we call god in my home. We thank god every time something goes really well and the rest of the time we ask for nothing. I like my relationship with god to be this way."
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","mind_body","I would much more like to retain the mind of a thirty year old than the body. I think it is much more important to be able to have a sharp mind. A 30 year old body is useful but really will not earn you the respect that a 90 year old deserves"
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","famous","I would love to be famous in two ways. The first way would be a a person that develops a restaurant idea for under served communities. The second one would be that I would really want to invent something that is really needed. "
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","how_raised","I would really have loved not to have been raised in an alcoholic abusive household. I was treated horrible in my youth and severely abused. It would have saved me time in learning that I am really a good person.  It also would have saved me $30000 in therapy bills. "
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","friend_value","That I can trust them. I think that trust is the most important thing. If I can tell my friend something and I know that they will help me and not judge me. That gives me a sense of security. "
"R_24Jb1Ds1XxrkkZX","garden","We have a garden. I live off grid on top of a mountain and the season is really short. The garden has a deer proof and critter proof fence.  The first year we were up there everything was eaten and we had to learn our lesson that we are the only food source for miles around.  this is really the first year that the garden was sucsessful."

"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","religious","No, I'm not religious. My parents were raised in relatively religious families but by the time we were born they had dropped any pretense of being religious. So we were not raised in any belief system. And although I tried to get interested in religion at school, there were too many inconsistencies and unbelievable things in the stories we were told for me to seriously go for it."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","strangest","I guess it's that it used to be that rundown neighborhood where people would not venture after dark. I come from New York you see, and my parents were artists and broke, so they chose to move in Soho, back then when Soho was not fashionable, nor safe, by any stretch of the imagination. So the neighborhood was full of colorful characters and weird things happening at night..."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","garden","I have a small garden behind my house. It's not huge, by any means but it's really pretty. And there is a mulberry tree to answer your question about fruits and trees. Other than that there is also a lot of lavender, lilies, morning glories and tons of hibiscus shrubs."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","fire_rescue","My computer I guess, or my external drive with my backup. If it's only one thing I can retrieve then it's not even worth trying to sort out what is important and what counts a little less. I'd just go for data!"
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","last_sing","I kind of hum all the time. Mostly snippets of a song that I heard recently. Sometimes I don't even know where the snippet comes from but I hum it over and over. And I sing songs to my husband once in a while. Pretty often actually, the last time was probably yesterday. But it's mostly for laughs, I certainly don't fathom myself a singer."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","famous","No. I don't see the point really. Rich? Sure! But famous? What for? To have paparazzi after you at all times and fans who think you owe them something because they love you? Maybe if I were a famous scientist, maybe that would be better, but only because that would mean I had accomplished something serious, not for the fans."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","like_work","I a Service Coordinator in a nonprofit for women. So basically I make sure that our members get the services they should get, in a timely manner. In practice, that means a lot of coordinating with various departments to make sure they're all on the same page. And it also means I end up acting as an informal counselor and social worker once in a while. I love it because I feel it's really useful - we actually make people's lives better!"
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","friend_value","Kindness, generosity, an open mind and open arms. I like kind and warm people and I can't think of one of my friends that could be described as being cold or not generous. And wit and thoughtfulness are also pretty important because I love to have interesting conversations."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","how_raised","My parents are great, and they gave us a fun childhood, but it was not perfect of course. And I think the point where they were a little off base was when it came to direction. My parents are people who are so respectful of others and who so value other people's personal freedom, even the freedom of making huge mistakes, that they were not big on suggesting ways for us to lead our life, even when we were kids. They would help us if we asked but there were a lot of things we had to figure out by ourselves. A bit more of a hands-on attitude would have helped us I think."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","why_studies","To earn a bit of additional money. We bought a house a few years ago and it changed things in all sorts of ways. It's great, mostly, but it's a lot more in terms of monthly payments than what we used to pay when we rented. So now, if we want to travel or buy something a little expensive, we need additional income - which is where MTurk comes in."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","cute_baby","My friend's young son was recently at a party where I was. He's a very social boy and he had been playing with all the other kids all night long when the hostess came to get her little girl to put her to bed. And when my friend's son heard that the baby would need a story before going to sleep, he volunteered to do it. And he read a whole storybook to that baby he barely knew, just because he felt like it. It's pretty uncommon and charming coming from a 7 year old I think."
"R_25T1x7nHtkAUj8y","mind_body","I'd definitely go with the body! Imagine being young like that until the end of your life - it's the dream, isn't it? I mean physical aging is not particularly fun. Psychological aging is not great either, and slowly turning senile certainly is not on my bucket list, but since people in my family don't typically lose their mind as they age and stay sharp until the end, I think it would be a safe bet to go with the 30 year old body."

"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","famous","I would not like to be famous because I don't like getting that much attention. I feel like it would be added pressure in my life and I would be unhappy. If I were to be famous, however, I would like it to be for something involving helping others in a great way."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is giggle uncontrollably. There was this one time when I saw a baby laughing hysterically. I could not help but laugh and I think it was the cutest thing ever"
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","how_raised","If I could change something about the way I was raised it would be that the area where I was raised was different. I wish my mom could have raised me in a more culturally diverse area. It would have given me more exposure to all different types of people and make me a culturally aware person today."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","last_sing","I sang to myself last in the shower this morning. I normally do not sing in the shower but today a song popped into my head while I was in. Then I just randomly started singing it."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the fact that it is so rural. There are hardly any people of any other ethnicity except for white people. I really wish it were different and is a main reason I moved away."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","religious","I am not a religious person because I do not agree with organized religions. I feel that I am spiritual in some ways but I don't like gathering with others in a church at all. I fell like the church discriminates against a lot of different people which I do not agree with at all."

"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","fire_rescue","I would make a final dash to save my laptop. I would do this because it has all of my photos backed up on it and has a lot of personal files I would not want to loose. It would be a valuable item to run back in and get because of these reasons."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","mind_body","I believe I would retain the body of a 30 year old out of the two options. I feel like the mind of a 90 year old is wise and experienced in life. So if I chose the 30 year old body I could still do active things I love."
"R_265UqirWcT7BfLw","friend_value","I value honesty the most in friendship. I think it is the single most important thing in a friendship because it allows everyone to be open and real with one another. I think that communication of this honesty is something that can really improve a friendship in many ways."

"R_26bDUpLAglwxhTn","religious","No, I am not. My family never taught my about religion.

I am not confident with my skill as a singer, I don't routinely let anyone hear me sing.  I sing to myself all the time.  I sing in the shower, sing in the car, if no one is home, I'll turn on a CD and sing in the house!"

"R_277IrAvAAa4CzI9","how_raised","I would have been raised by different parents.  My mother suffered from bi-polar disease and she self-medicated with alcohol.  My siblings and I were left to raise ourselves most of the time and I always have felt like I could have achieved more as an adult if I'd had a better support system as a child."
"R_277IrAvAAa4CzI9","mind_body","Wouldn't it be nice if we could have both?  If I had to chose, I'd prefer the mind of a 30 year old.  It scares me to think of getting old and having problems with my brain like forgetting things or finding it hard to do things I used to be able to do like balance a checkbook.  I know I'd be happier being able to think clearly than I would be with my younger body."

There is no way of getting the photographs back, many of my pictures were taken before digital cameras.  If I lost the film and the picture, I'd lose everything."
"R_277IrAvAAa4CzI9","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is acceptance.  I think because I was raised in such a judgemental home that I really appreciate people who accept and like me for who I am.  It is especially nice if you can also find a friend who makes you laugh and who has your back."

"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","friend_value","I value trustworthiness above all else. I need to be able to trust people that I am close with. Having friends means opening up to them about things that I may not want others to know about. I need to know that what I share will be kept between us."

"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","famous","I don't think that I would like being famous. While it might come with a lot of money, I wouldn't want a complete lack of privacy. I feel like the more famous you are, the more you're directly in the public eye and everything you do is scrutinized. I like having the ability to be invisible and mind my own business when I want."

There's a lot of irreplaceable stuff on there and I would probably want to grab that to make sure I still have it all."
"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","religious","No, I wouldn't say that I'm religious. I do believe in God but I think believing and following a religion along with all of their rules is silly and ridiculous. Think of how many religions there are. Think of how much they contradict each other. There's one god, multiple gods, no gods, reincarnation, no reincarnation, god is omnipotent, there's free will, your life has already been decided at birth. It is all contracdictory. They can't all be correct and no one knows which (if any) are correct. Why dedicate your life to something with a high likelihood of being incorrect?"
"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","strangest","There wasn't anything particularly strange about where I grew up. I think the weirdest thing is probably how much it has changed over the years. When I first moved there, there was a lot of farm land in the surrounding area. There was some residential area and that's about it. Since then, the land has been developed, stores added, highways brought through. It looks unrecognizable from when I first moved there."
"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","mind_body","I would probably want the mind of a 30 year old. I would be afraid of developing the diseases that rob you of your ability to think. I want to be able to know what's going on and communicate with others clearly. And I don't want to look like I'm 30 at the nursing home. That would be weird."
"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","last_sing","I sing to myself and my daughters in the car almost every day on the way to and from daycare. They have all their songs that they like to request and I play them on my phone. Then we all sing along to them together as loud as we can. We always have fun with that."
"R_28G8iEDNdyezWj1","like_work","I work as an analyst. I like it because the work can be challenging which I love taking on and I think my company does a lot of good in the world. I enjoy my coworkers and I like working on teams to get things done. I think it suits my needs well for a career."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","famous","No, I wouldn't want to be famous.  There would be less privacy and I like my privacy.  I'm a person who does't like a lot of attention on me, so being famous would not be my cup of tea."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","friend_value","I value loyalty most in a friendship.  I like a friend who will stick with me no matter what.  Someone who is more like family to me and me to them.  Loyalty, knowing that I can tell that friend anything and it would be safe with my friend and wouldn't go further if I didn't want it to."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","last_sing"," The last time I sang was watching a commercial on t.v.  The song in the commercial was an old song that I really liked so I started singing it to my husband who was nearby. I do this quite often so he's come to expect it."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","religious","No, I'm not religious.  I was raised believing in god or a higher power, but I was told It doesn't matter where you pray, god hears you anywhere so we never went to church.  Although I do pray once in awhile, I never really practice my religion, in that I really don't think about it much in my daily life."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","why_studies","I like doing these studies online because it helps my financial situation first and foremost.  But I also like them because I actually learn a lot from them.  I learn a lot about myself by answering questions such as personality questions.  I also enjoy the challenge of some of these studies that have math or other kinds of tasks.  I also like the fact that I'm actually helping research."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","how_raised","Although I had a really good childhood, I would change being raised with having more confidence in myself. I think maybe being told that I could do whatever I wanted would have helped my self esteem.  Also being able to be a little more independent would have help with that as well."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","cute_baby","The cutest thing for me is seeing a baby belly laughing.  It is just the cutest thing and really gets me laughing right along with them.  And it's funny because that laugh at the silliest things like paper ripping, or a sound someone makes."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","fire_rescue","I think I would grab as many of my family pictures as I could.  Pictures are pages of your life and they are hard to replace.  Although some family members may have some pictures I could get from them, there are some that I have that no one else has, and I'd want to save these pictures."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","mind_body","I would love to keep both, but if I had to choose one, I would want to keep the body of a 30 year old.  If I had the body of a 30 year old, I could still be very active and still do things I wanted to do.  I would hate to not be able to move around and do things I love doing."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","like_work","I work in a radon lab.  We analyze kits that we send out for people to test their homes for radon gas.  They send the test back to us for analysis. I like the job because it makes people aware of dangers that could be inside their homes and gives them the opportunity to fix it before getting sick from it.  It's a rewarding job."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","strangest","The strangest thing was that the town was so small.  Whenever I went somewhere else to shop, I felt like I was going to a new world.  My little town was a place where everyone knew each other.  Going out of bounds of the town was like a strange experience, like stepping into an alternate reality."
"R_28LE3gKzNePaXLW","garden","Not at the moment.  I am renting the house I live in now so I really haven't put forth the effort to put in a garden. Once I buy my own house, I will put in a vegetable garden and fruit trees as I love fresh veges and fruits."
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","strangest","Derry was one of those towns that has the rich people but also has really poor people. It was strange to see people in school that had all this money and others receiving free lunch. It was a shock to see how the rich kids dressed and how the poor kids dressed. Pretty sad. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","religious","I am not a religious person. I do not believe that there is a god looking over us. I believe there might be some kind of god that created the earth and the other planets. As far as someone who people go to church and pray to, that's not the kind of god I believe in. I guess you could say I am agnostic. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","garden","I do not have any of those. We live in a condo building and the outside doesn't have any space for that kind of stuff. I really wish we did though. We should be growing our own food. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","mind_body","I would want to have the mind of a 30 year old. Because the mind takes care of the body in a lot of ways. If you think young then there is a big part of you that can make your body young too. I would not want the mind of a 90 year old because most likely it isn't a good one. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is when they smile. Some of the smiles scare me but for the most part they are very cute. They are also cute when I hear them making the cooing sounds. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","why_studies","I do these studies so we can have extra money. We don't make enough as it is so these studies make sure that we have stuff we need for the week. The money that I make every week goes to our food and whatever else we need for the week. This provides extra. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","how_raised","I would have changed the way that my parents handled certain things. There were problems early in my life that should have been addressed sooner. Maybe then I would not have the mental health issues I have now. Maybe I could be working full time making real money instead of being on disability and working part time. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","friend_value","Being loyal to one another is very important in a friendship. Not taking advantage of each other. Making sure that you have each others back when things in life get tough. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","like_work","My regular job is a security officer. I work at NHBB on the weekends and holidays. I like how I am on my own mostly with no one to deal with. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","fire_rescue","I would choose my computer. It has all of my important pictures and documents on it. It would take me forever to get the money for a new computer and I would not be able to replace the pictures. These pictures are everything I have. "
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","last_sing","I last sang to myself this morning. I always like to sing to you. I sang to you last night remember?"
"R_28LOh3DwDyJGsdR","famous","I would not like to be famous. I do not want to be in the spotlight and having people chase after me to get my picture or to talk with me. I just want to be left alone and being famous doesn't give you that option. "
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","garden","I only have a 2 plants currently . One is a succulent with a pink head I named pracsilla and the other is a aloe vera plant. I will however like to have a much bigger garden to grow herbs and other edible plants in! I need to wait though till I at least had a good place I could put the plants where they can get easy sun."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","cute_baby","I personally have not had much experience around children so far. I do however believe it is cute when a baby gets all excited when you are playing peekaboo with it. Also children playing games like patacake are precious."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","mind_body","I would choose body. The one thing I have feared the most when it comes to age is loosing my looks. To be able to look 30 for the last 60 years of my life would be so amazing. I believe it would take away so much anxiety about age thus in a way also helping my mind to better cope. I believe in that sense it will be a win- win."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","fire_rescue","It would be my phone. After a fire all the important numbers I would need to call are in it. I keep a bunch of beloved photos on it. Plus it is the easiest way to access my bank account."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","religious","No my mom tried her best to drill religion into my head. I feel like she is the person who turned me off to religion the most however. Saying things like All non-Christians are likened to devil worshipers. ""Anybody who is not Christians will have a bad thing happen to them in life"" yet  she could not explain what that bad thing was! She even tried to say ""her life was hard because I was non-religious"". Honestly I believe religion was just created in order to explain things we were not able to explain way back then."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","like_work","Well currently I work in a grocery store produce department. I like being surrounded by a lot of fruit and vegetables. I especially love stocking the strawberries as they always smell so good. Every time I am by them I feel like I am in heaven. I also love how it is a more slow paced job Since once everything is opened I am kinda just waiting for stuff to sell down so I can restock it. I am also vegan so I believe produce is the best place I can work in a grocery store!"
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","how_raised","There are a bunch of things I would change. First thing is getting beat as a child. Now that I am grown up and have been able to see the studies that show how they affect children long term. It is something I will never approve of as I can see some problems in my adult self that was may or may not have been a result of it. Also I'd like to have a better mom overall. When I was being bullied and really really needed someone there she kinda just said ""suck it up"". ""How will you fare in the adult world if this makes you cry?"" "" Get stronger."" She also would make fun of my voice and taunt me about it like the bullies in school were. I was a very quiet child and I feel because of this I was incapable of really opening up till I got to high school. All and all all I really want is a bit more compassion from my mother in how I was raised."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","last_sing","Well as a matter of fact I sung to myself last night! I was at work last night and doing closing in the produce back room. I had my headphones on and I was listening to And one "" Military fashion show"" and was singing as I cleaned. I have never actually sung to someone though. I have always been to shy about my voice so the closest I have gotten was me reading out lyrics to someone."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","why_studies","Frankly because I really really need the money. However I also enjoy writing so a study like this brings me a whole lot of pleasure. It is mostly for the money though as my full time job I do not make enough to live on completely. Any extra money I can bring in is in fact good because of that. Also since this is something I can do online in the comforts of my own home therefore I do not have to deal with my social anxiety very much."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","famous","I personally do not think I could handle the fame. I can already barely deal with and uptick of friend requests on facebook. If I ever became famous though I suppose it would either be for my ""look"" as I have a very what I would call a dark skin goth dolly kind of look or my art. I am fairly good drawing and enjoy drawing real people, animals and anime styled people."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","friend_value","In a friendship the most important virtue I feel is honesty. If someone is willing to betray you with dishonesty they are not much of a friend to begin with. I also like people whom I have a few things in common with. That way I can really let go about everything and feel A- Okay because this person is also like me and can relate."
"R_29nB5UJxMeOBxvl","strangest","The town I grew up in was a tiny town called Cartersville. It seemed there was an abnormally high people my age doing hard drugs. It is very strange to see when I travel up to it to see family. I believe it is a crap shoot of a town but it is still my hometown."
"R_2AFH0husBTiKxLf","religious","Yes I am a religious person. Its just a way I grew up and I like it. Its very good for me and my life. "
"R_2AFH0husBTiKxLf","friend_value","To me is knowing that someone has your back. I like when people will be there for you. Nothing like that loyalty."
"R_2AFH0husBTiKxLf","cute_baby","Anytime they talk is cute to me. When babies are just learning to speak. To me they say the sweetest and cutest things. "

"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","mind_body","I would like to keep the body of a 30-year-old. I think the mind can stay sharp if it’s properly taken care of. I wouldn’t like to suffer physical pain as a result of an old body."
"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","fire_rescue","It’s a difficult choice but I would pick a watch my dad gave me. This watch is important to me because he gave it to me before he died. The watch has a lot of sentimental value so I would try to save it."
"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","why_studies","I think they are fun and also like the extra money. Most of the studies are short and are fairly easy to do. I like that some of them are also mobile friendly and so when I’m bored I can do them."
"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","strangest","The place I grew up in is pretty normal. It’s hard to say the strangest thing as everything seemed ordinary. I would say the strangest things was the look of the house. It looked different than the other houses"
"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","how_raised","I wouldn’t change anything. I had a good childhood and the things that I didn’t liked forged my character. I liked every aspect of it even the bad times."

"R_2aJFAREphLuPy62","religious","I’m not a religious person. I believe that there is a God but I don’t believe in any religion. I don’t believe in religions because they all lie and many acts of war have been using religion as an excuse."

I would definitely elect to keep the body of my younger self."
"R_2CBYz5EVjgrLtET","friend_value","Honestly, above all, I value a great sense of humor in a friendship. My friends are a very diverse group of people, from all sorts of backgrounds, but the thread that binds them is the ability to not take things too seriously and have a good laugh. Of course, it's also good to have relatively compatible personalities; being an alpha, it's fairly hard to be good friends with another strong alpha."

As my musical instrument is insured (a common practice among professionals), I would grab my knife collection. No, this isn't cheating, as my knife collection resides in a single case, constituting one item."
"R_2CBYz5EVjgrLtET","famous","In short, yes, but only for the right reasons. As an aspiring orchestral musician, I would love to one day be recognized as one of the greats on my instrument.

I, like many broke college students, have tried various survey sites, hoping to make some pocket change, to no avail. Mechanical turk has kept my interest because it's a fairly legitimate enterprise."
"R_2CBYz5EVjgrLtET","religious","Child of a single mother who couldn't finish college because of my surprise arrival, I had little time for the church when I was a kid. My mom was busy at work to support us, and religion was simply never a part of our lives. Even now that I could fit it in to my schedule to go to service, I don't see the appeal."
"R_2CBYz5EVjgrLtET","how_raised","I am generally pretty content with my childhood, but I suppose if there's anything I would change, I would have had my sisters enter my life at a much earlier age. I have been estranged from my father since shortly after birth, and while I wouldn't change a thing about that, I wish I had known about and met my younger half-sisters while I was still a child. I often wonder what it would be like if my siblings and I could have actually grown up together."

So you can go there, walk around, but 90% of the mall is empty. There is only a few stores actually there, and everything else is empty.

Especially when I was with my girlfriend who was later to become my third wife. I am now way too self-conscious. She liked my impromptu karaoke and thinks I should sing with her in the church choir. I do not want to sing in the choir at all. Come to think of it, that is actually why I don't sing to myself anymore -- choirphobia.

In fact, the willingness to lie to each other is what keeps some friends together. You offer praise when they stink. You overlook their many faults and deny them when others may point them out. Compatibility implies shared experiences and interests. Sharing is what friendship is based on."

"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","mind_body","I would rather keep the body of a 30 year old.   This is less about the appearance than it is about the functionality. The last 10 years of life tend to be hard on one's physical functionality and i'd like to skip that part of aging"
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","last_sing","I was walking around singing the theme from the Mary tyler Moore show this morning. I sang it to myself and when I encountered other people I sang it to them too.  I tend to get stuff stuck in my head that way"
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","cute_baby","I'm not generally a huge kid person. That said, I remember when my friend's child was 3-4 years old and announced that she never wanted to get married. When we asked her why, she answered with ""When you live alone, you can do what you want and no one can bother you."""
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","strangest","I grew up in a crowded urban area. I would say the strangest thing is that there were so many people there and yet, I knew so few of them.  I think people who grow up in cities learn to be alone in crowds."
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","fire_rescue","My computer.  It has a lot of pictures on it and things I'd want to remember so it would be the easiest way for me to save the most things.  By and large though, my pets and family would be enough."
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","how_raised","My parents would have paid better attention to what I was doing.  I spent a lot of time on my own and could have used more supervision.  My parents were so preoccupied with my sister that they had little time for me. My mother seemed to only like people who were having problems, so if  I was doing well, I was largely ignored."
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","religious","I'm completely non religious.  I do not have the belief system that lends itself to that.  I don't like ritual, and i have trouble belonging to tribes."
"R_2diFSpuvVR6cOD6","famous","I have absolutely no interest in being famous.  I don't like attention, and I'd prefer to not receive it from strangers.  I can't think of a single way in which it would appeal to me."

"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","last_sing","About a month ago I tried to sing the cover version of ""Sound of Silence"" by the band ""Disturbed"". It seems easier than the original for an amateur like me but still, being completely unable to sing takes its toll. I forgot to mention that I was alone (obviously!), doing it while someone else was present would be a extremely awkward to say the least. Being alone definitely helps with the confidence. I've never tried to sing while anyone was listening/watching.  "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","religious","I consider that the universe is a very interesting place and we, humans aren't capable of understanding the fundamental processes happening which make the universe behave the way it does. We can not even answer the question whether we are in a simulation or not. There are a lot of unanswered questions and just like ants in my yard will never learn how to build an android application, neither shall we ever know what's really going on. Religion is just an easy and useless way to handle the complexities of life. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","mind_body","I would definitely want to retain my 30-year-old mind. The reason is very simple. It is likely that our civilization is on the verge of understanding human consciousness fully and creating some kind of way to transfer our mind in a non-biological body. Sure, I'm on a sci-fi territory now and it is likely that our species will never achieve that but I want to remain faithful and retain my young mind for the obvious purposes. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","cute_baby","Frankly speaking, I'm not really fond of children. They make a mess out of everything, are too loud and almost always interfere with your peaceful existence but generally speaking, the cutest thing a child does is the first expression of curiosity about their surroundings. The desire to find out where they are and what this existence is all about. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","famous","I would definitely like to be famous. Being famous, especially nowadays - during the epoch of social media,  is equivalent of being rich. You'll be able to live a great life and enjoy every moment of it. Maybe I'm seeing only from my perspective and it must be much more complicated than that but still, I want to experience what it feels like to be famous and truly rich."
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","fire_rescue","That would be my Kindle. I love reading books, it's like one of my favorite passions and I cannot imagine living without a good book to read. The kindle is my choice of medium to transfer all the ideas right into my memories. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","how_raised","I would make myself aware of how bad it is to be overweight for one's health and I would do it much earlier than I happened to realize it myself when I was 15. Taking care of your own body, your vessel should be the number one priority. Unless humans really find out to transfer consciousness, I think we can agree that we are stuck in our bodies so let's just take care of them..."
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","garden","I have a garden of tomatoes in my yard and I care a lot about it. Unfortunately, my yard is quite small but I still manage to cultivate enough for me to last for a season. It takes discipline and consistent maintenance, however that is a part of the fun so I cannot complain. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","why_studies","The main reason is that I want to supplement my income from here. There is another reason though. I feel that being here and participating in various studies makes me a part of them to some degree. Enables me to help the advancement of science in a way. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","strangest","The strangest thing is that people are very religious. They are devoted Christians who carry out all the well established rituals but in reality, they are just wearing the masks of saints. It is just a facade and they are the simpleminded folk who simply hate everything different and everything their tiny brains do not understand. Frankly speaking, that's what religions do to masses. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","like_work","I'm working as a hostel manager. It's a small establishment and I have a lot of duties there. One of my duties is to take care of the staff and be kind of an anchor for them. I also like supplementing my income from Amazon Mturk. "
"R_2DRKrj7FTbsBy7h","friend_value","I value honesty above all. Say all the nasty things, unleash your wildest fantasies and unimaginably strange desires, act in a certain way that may be considered ill-mannered even by me but never lie. Being mutually truthful and honest is the one, most important aspect of a true friendship. "
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","like_work","I'm a part time stay at home mom and part time technician. I like the flexibility that it gives me, and I like that I have enough time to see my son figure out things about the world. I think if I was to do either full time I would go a little crazy so it's a good balance."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","fire_rescue","I think it would probably be a family heirloom/jewelry piece. I think my family would appreciate it most if that's what I grabbed and would feel confident in entrusting it with me. Otherwise, most things are simply materialistic goods and I don't really have much emotional attachment."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","how_raised","I think I would want my childhood family to be more verbal in their support. It was fairly known by everyone that we would be there for each other but I'm still surprised by verbal affirmations that other families give to each other. I try to correct that and regularly tell my son that I love him."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","famous","No, I don't think so. It feels as though privacy violations are always talked about by famous people and I don't think I would appreciate that. I enjoy living a rather simple, modest life with my family."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","cute_baby","I'm not really sure. I'm fortunate enough to have a toddler in my life who regularly does cute or funny things. I guess I think it's cutest when he's in his dance class and doing all of the steps with his friends."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","friend_value","I think I value honesty and compassion most in a friendship. It seems like the people around me should be supportive but not dishonest. I would  want someone who was open minded and empathetic with all kinds of people."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","religious","No, I don't really follow a religion at all. I was raised fairly agnostic and never really found a calling to change that. There's too much unknown to really subscribe to a specific religion and too much that butts against known scientific truths."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of the thirty year old. I find that without my mind, I am essentially nothing. My mental facilities are much more important to me than my physical capabilities, although I would be sad to lose the latter."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","garden","I do! I actually have a small home garden outside in my backyard. It's mostly tomatoes and peppers at the moment. I have an assortment of small spice plants as well."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","strangest","That it was one of the safest places in my mind, and it got hit by a mass shooting. I always thought it was so safe that it was boring and that would have been the least likely thing I could have thought to have happened there. I guess that's less ""strange"" so much as ""surprising"" and ""horrifying."""
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","why_studies","They allow time to be filled with okay pay. If work is slow or there's not much else to be done, it allows me enough money for groceries. It's not a lot and sometimes things get repetitive but overall it's worthwhile."
"R_2DSQMe1bkuWsmdE","last_sing","I  honestly can't remember the last time I sang to myself. My toddler enjoys it when I sing simple songs like the ABC's with him. Probably the last time we did that would be last weekend."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","friend_value","A friend is someone who is with you no matter what and they stick by you. There is no other motive but to just be a friend. A friendship should not be judgmental, but understanding and compromising."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","like_work","Right now I run a small business and I work on Mechanical Turk. I like the independence and flexibility it allows me. I like being my own boss. It is not easy, and it can be more difficult than having a guaranteed paid job. My goal and dream is to have my own successful business and I am happy to be working towards this."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","strangest","There really wasn't anything strange about where I grew up. It was a working to middle class suburb. The neighborhood was fairly normal, and it was a good place to grow up. The conditions of my home life on the other hand is another story!"
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","last_sing","I don't know? I like to sing along to music in my own time and at home. It would probably have been ""Happy Birthday"" at the last birthday party I was at."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","religious","I have strong beliefs and faith. However, I don't really consider myself a religious person. I am a Christian, and my main concern is in the truth. I don't want to be bound by specific actions, traditions, or denominations."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","famous","Not really or particularly. I value my privacy. If I had to choose what I was famous for it would be for my creativity as an artist and craftsperson. Or, as a business owner pertaining to an art business."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","garden","Not right now. We live in a small apartment. There is not much window space or outdoor space for plants. And, we have cats! They like to try to eat the plants, so I gave up on having the plants indoors. I miss having plants and hope to have some again in the future."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","cute_baby","There are many cute things that I have seen, but there is one event that comes to mind. My nephews were playing with a small flag. It belonged to the older nephew. The little nephew broke the flag pole. Everything stops and the big nephew made such an expressive face and goes, ""Oh noooo! He broke it!"". He was just so expressive and cute. I felt bad about the broken flag, but we were able to fix it."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","mind_body","I think I would choose the mind. Nobody wants to lose any functions. In keeping the mind there would be clarity, memories, sound choice, and all the other things that might be taken for granted."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","fire_rescue","It would probably be a photo album. I wouldn't want to lose older photos that are not backed up digitally. The memories would be too important to lose."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","why_studies","It is one of my jobs. I need the money to pay bills and live on. It is great because it allows me to have flexibility and work on my own business. When things get slow in one area, it is nice to have other avenues of work available."
"R_2dsTjagrNpkiz28","how_raised","That both parents were actively in my life and I wasn't left alone so much. When I say alone, I was left to do almost whatever I wanted to. There was little guidance or structure. My home life and situation was very dysfunctional. There was a lot more going on, but I'd rather not delve into that for now."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do is to gaze lovingly at their mother. The baby's smile is priceless and just lights up the room. It also makes the mother and everyone else around feel good too."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","famous","I don't have any dreams of being famous because I'm a very behind-the-scenes type person. I prefer to just blend into the crowd and not be the center of attention. If I had to be famous, I'd probably prefer it to be in art or music."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I think it would be my family structure. I would have liked to have had a sibling closer to my own age so I would have had someone to play with. Having siblings much older than myself made me feel somewhat of an only child."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","like_work","Right now I do Mechanical Turk for work. I like the flexibility of being able to work at any time, day or night, and any day of the week. I also like the freedom of being able to work from home, as well as being able to choose which assignments I'd like to do."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden, but I would like to. I used to have a lot of indoor plants when I was young. Right now, I'm living in a climate that's too hot for me to spend a lot of time outside, but someday if I move, I'll probably grow a vegetable garden."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","religious","I'm not a very religious person, even though I grew up Catholic. I think that's because I'm very logical, reasoning, and everything has to make sense to me. However, I always hope that there's something good out there after life."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","last_sing","I never sing to anyone else, unless they accidentally happen to hear me while I'm singing to myself. However, I usually sing to myself every weekend when I'm listening to an oldies music program playing on the radio. I sing to myself when I hear a song that I particularly like."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","friend_value","I value acceptance most in a friendship. Having acceptance means I can be myself around my friend and still be valued, appreciated, and liked. I don't consider it a friendship if I have to pretend to be something I'm not."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","mind_body","Although having both a sound mind and a healthy body are important to me, I'd have to choose having the body of a 30-year old. Having a younger body would allow me to enjoy the exercising I like to do to keep fit. In return for the younger body, sacrificing the sharp mind would be acceptable to me because I don't like to do brainy things anyway."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","strangest","I can't really think of too much that's strange about where I grew up, so I'd have to say what class mates thought was strange. Many thought it was strange that I had a large hill with a cemetery in back of where I lived. I guess they found that spooky and weird."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","fire_rescue","I would save the box I keep under my bed filled with memories from my mother and my pet that passed away. The box contains my mother's hand prints, my favorite picture of her, and the only DVD with a few seconds of her talking to me on it. The box also contains locks of fur from my pet, and her favorite ball toy that we used to play with."
"R_2e4r6hze8OV3Gdo","why_studies","I do these online studies as my sole source of income. Although it's always been difficult to find a job, I think it's gotten worse as years have gone by and I've gotten older. I'm grateful to have found Mechanical Turk as a source of income."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","garden","We have a fig tree in the backyard, but the last few years it hasn't produced any fruit. When I was younger we had a raspberry bush that I loved, but they grow wild and its hard to contain it. We have a ton of houseplants, and we also have a garden outside with flowers and some herbs like parsley and mint."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","fire_rescue","I would save photo albums because they are our memories. My dad passed away last year and we have so many photos through the years that my mom took. Also we have photos of people from the past, and they are not digital or on any icloud."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","last_sing","I sing to myself all the time! I have a horrible voice but if I'm alone especially I will sing. Like this morning when I was driving in my car to work. The last time I sang to someone else, was probably singing happy birthday to my mom."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","strangest","The strangest thing about my town is that everyone thinks they're rich. I grew up in a well off area but not ""rich"" by any means. However, the high school parking lot is full of BMWs and Mercedes bought by parents for their ungrateful kids. Then a ton of people move to a cheaper area when their kids go off to college."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","like_work","I am a research analyst for television. I use historical data for various markets around the US to come up with ratings for tv programs for specific stations. I don't mind it, but it's not something I want to do forever."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","how_raised","I think I was raised pretty well. I think I would remove the pressure I subconsciously felt to succeed at everything. I never noticed it because succeeding was always easy for me to do, but now I look at things and feel like my anxieties are based on that it was always expected of me."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","mind_body","Wow that's a good question. I think I would rather retain the mind of a 30 year old, because the mind starts going when you get older and it would be more beneficial to remember things when you are old. Besides, having a body of a 30 year old when you're 90 is kind of creepy. Unless you're trying to pick up some young guys!"
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","famous","I think I would like to be famous. I'd like to be a musician, but as I said before, I can't sing. I'd want to be a chill kind of famous though, not Taylor Swift level where everyone is watching and critiquing your every move. Famous like, I can go to the grocery store when I want, but can also get a backstage pass to my favorite bands concerts."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do, is come over to snuggle with me. My best friend's one year old toddled over to me so I picked him up and we sat on the couch. He rested his head on my shoulder and we sat like that for a half hour. It was such a sweet moment."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","why_studies","I lost my job about two years ago. I was offered one job after a year of unemployment. It, of course, was half of my previous salary. I needed extra income to help pay off bills and student loans."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","religious","I'm sort of religious. I attended church often when I was younger, but now it's just the major holidays. I think some things need to be amended in the Catholic church, but I do believe in God and Jesus."
"R_2EF8gQO5ZCzXZU8","friend_value","In a friendship I value loyalty. I have no time for fairweather friends. It's good and important to have people you can count on, and vice versa. You get to pick your friends, so you might as well pick good ones."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","how_raised","That's a tough question.  We were raised just fine.  My parents were honest, hard working people and passed that on to my sister and I.  If anything could change, I would want for them to have had it a little bit easier while raising us."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","religious","I am not a religious person nor a spiritual person.  I simply believe that we are all in charge of our lives, not some unseen person.  I grew up thinking this and now in my adult life I still believe it.  I wonder, as I near death's door, will I change my thinking?"
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up would have to be ""hole #9"".  It was a space in the brook that ran behind our farmhouse.  In the summer you could swim in it.  Oddly enough, what makes it so strange is that neither my sister nor I know why it's called ""hole #9"" and since our mother has long since passed, we may never solve the mystery."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","friend_value","Now this is a great question.  What I value most in a friendship is a challenge.  Someone who challenges me, as I challenge them, to be all that they can be.  To be a great lover, fighter, to be financially savvy and most importantly to just be my friend."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","like_work","I am proud to say that I grow tomatoes in the mid-west area of the United States.  I have done this for many many years, well approaching three decades now.  I so enjoy watching the plants start from seed and grow big and strong, only to yield so much fruit for people to marvel at and enjoy.  Tomatoes aren't just red in color you know; there is a whole rainbow, including a special variety called chocolate rose, that is nearly black on the outside and a bright red on the inside.  Delicious."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","last_sing","I enjoy singing.  I like karaoke and have a machine in my living room just for this.  I have friends that come over about once a month for some snacks and singing.  We always have a great time, lots of laughter, and even sometimes tears."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","famous","I am not sure that I would like to be famous.  Fame and attention is not part of my humble make up.  I would rather do something behind the scenes and watch from afar the success that my efforts have done.  I believe in literacy and quietly fund a program in the local elementary school here in town to make sure kids that can't afford books, get new books each month.  That's good enough for being famous to me."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","mind_body","I believe the mind is fascinating, therefore I would want to retain my mental facilities.  There would be so much to share and learn with family, friends, and even strangers.  So much history to pass along."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","fire_rescue","Oh this is a horrible scenario, indeed!  If I was going to rush back in there, I would grab this medium sized box I keep in my bedroom.  Inside are the contents of many years, decades even, of my family's history.  Newspaper clippings, photos, important letters...years and years worth.  This is what I would grab, so that the next generation could enjoy them as I have."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","why_studies","I enjoy these online studies greatly.  I didn't attend university, so this is my way of contributing in some sort of way and to also learn about new things.  Some can be mundane, sure.  But some are very fascinating, and those are the ones that make the whole endeavor worthwhile."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","garden","Thank you for asking!  Yes, I do.  I have several apple trees, peach trees, and raspberry bushes.  A strawberry plot flourishes in July.  I grow tomatoes to share with neighbors and local food pantries.  I have a small vegetable garden for myself.  This coming summer I plan on trying my hand at growing peppermint."
"R_2EgJ3KUqvqgV6Cy","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do is grow up.  Watching a child learn words to speak, then when they can recognize them on paper, and then when they can spell them and use them in sentences and understand their meaning is a huge joy.  A child with a book that they are enjoying is a wonderful thing."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","like_work","I'm a freelancer. I do writing mostly, but I also have a few side gigs for extra cash flow. I also personally invest in stocks, but that's more about income than work."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","famous","I don't think so, unless I had a ton of money to go with it. If I could get the money and live under the radar forever, I think I'd like that. But I don't want to be a celebrity that's always the center of hot gossip."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","friend_value","I think trust is pretty important in terms of friendship. More trust than you can give to any stranger, and sometimes even more than some family. Trust is probably the most important part of any personal relationship, but friendship is one of the closest relationships you can have, so it's especially important for it."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","mind_body","I would probably choose body. Reason is, I wouldn't have to worry about physical vulnerabilities that plague the elderly, like frail bones and poor vision. I might still get dementia or something, but I think that's a lower chance than the other side of the coin."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","why_studies","They're a side gig I do for extra cash flow. They're pretty simple and don't require a lot of energy, but they can get tedious. It's also nice to be able to work from home or wherever I feel like without someone looking over my shoulder."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","strangest","We had a lot of land that we didn't do anything with, and I never knew why. Still don't know why, actually. I'm guessing it just came with the property. It was so much land that if you went halfway from one point to the other, you wouldn't be in ear-shot of the original point."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","fire_rescue","It would be the spoon my grandmother used for scooping coffee out of the bag. She gave it to me before her passing, and I use it for my own coffee. It's probably my most sentimental item, and I don't think there's anything else worth more to me aside from close family."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","last_sing","I've never sang to anyone else, but I sing songs in my head every day. I don't sing out loud though, since I'm awful and it would ruin the song. I think it helps me maintain a small passion for music without having to sit down and digest an album or more every day."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","cute_baby","I don't really see babies or children much, unless it's one of those fail videos on the internet. Those aren't really cute though, so I can't easily say. I guess babies trying to eat things that aren't food is pretty funny and cute."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","how_raised","I would make it so my parents taught me better personal hygiene. I was never really taught about it, which meant that I spent a number of years as ""that kid"" that always smelled weird and looked even worse. Once I was almost done with freshman year of high school I started getting better, but I still regret those years spent as ""that kid""."
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","religious","No, I'm not religious. I wasn't raised religiously even though my mother is a bit religious. I've never found any reason to believe a lot of the ""teachings"", and the Bible seems like a joke to me. I am spiritual though, meaning I do things like meditation to try and maintain my mental health. "
"R_2f7ZFdkFEvgulvZ","garden","No, I don't have any, but I would like to try growing some hot pepper plants at some point. They just seem like so much work, and I wouldn't want to do all that work if they end up either not growing, or dying during the cold season. If I ever move to a place with less sporadic weather I'd be more inclined to try it, but for now it probably won't be happening."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","strangest","I would say the strangest thing about where I grew up would be mix of city and farm kids.  You had some kids that wouldn't even be able to start a fire by themselves mixed with kids who had been hunting since they could walk practically and raised calves for 4-H.  There was a bit of a culture clash between the two later in high school as well.  It was always strange to see a guy in a leather jacket with studs and ripped jeans next to another guy wearing a cowboy hat and boots."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","mind_body","Well, that is a bit of a tough one.  I think I would prefer the body of a 30-year-old though.  My grandparents were both quite mentally sharp into their early 80s and I would hope for the same outcome in that area."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the shower, probably a month ago.  I had an ""earworm"" and was humming the song to myself all day, but I really belted it out in the shower.  As to someone else, the last time would have been ""Happy Birthday"" at my sister's party."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","like_work","I'm a Software Engineer and I work from home.  I like coding in part because I enjoy problem solving.  Each day there is a new problem to solve.  I think I would go crazy if I had to work in a factory or a warehouse doing the exact same thing day in and day out."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","garden","I don't have any fruit trees and there isn't space for a garden on my townhouse property.  However, I do have quite a few indoor plants.  I've got a Snake plant, a Spider plant, and quite a few Pothos plants.  I would like to get some indoor Bonsai plants as well. "
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","how_raised","I wish my parents would have placed more emphasis on ""stopping to smell the roses"" so to speak.  They were rather strict about homework and my studies.  It certainly helped me get into a good college, but I feel like I missed out on a lot of fun compared to my friends."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","famous","Honestly, I don't think I would.  Well, on second thought, I guess I wouldn't mind being a famous author.  It would be satisfying to have a lot of people like my books and ideas, and in theory you could use a nom de plume.  I wouldn't want to be recognized every time I went to the store though, that would get old fast! "
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","friend_value","I would say I value honestly and loyalty most in a friend.  Over the years, I've had friends come and go, and my oldest friendships are based on these values.  Having a friend you can trust and who will be there for you no matter what is a wonderful thing. "
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","religious","I'm not particularly religious.  As a child, my family went to church each Sunday, but I guess I kind of grew out of my faith.  I still attend a Christmas service with my parents each year though."
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","fire_rescue","I have a small collection of gold coins and I would try to save those.  They are in an easy to carry binder and are worth a decent amount of cash.  My pet cat is by far the most important thing though!"
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","why_studies","I find they are a nice break from the tedium of my job.  I work from home and I find it to be a bit of a mental ""palate"" cleanser to take a break from programming and take an online survey or study.  A little bit of extra money in the bank each month doesn't hurt either!"
"R_2fBqZe2awj5nhMi","cute_baby","I saw a friend's young child playing ""vet"" with her dog.  The dog had surgery on it's paw for some reason and was wearing the cone of shame.  My friend instructed his kid to put the dog's medicine into a bit of hamburger.  The little girl did that and said 'this will make you feel better"" as she gave the dog it's medicine. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","how_raised","I probably would have liked more focus being put toward the importance of my education and how to properly manage money."
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","famous","I would only want to be famous as a behind the scenes person. Like maybe a director or a producer. I wouldn't want to a recognizable actor or musician. I don't really like a lot of spectacle."

"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","like_work","I work on the financial industry in a support capacity. I like the flexibility and the freedom I get to have on my job. It's low stress and pretty laid back sometimes. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","strangest","I don't really remember anything uniquely strange about where I grew up, although it was quite boring. It was pretty far away from a lot of activities so we had to keep ourselves entertained."
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","cute_baby","My baby really likes to dance to theme songs when we watch TV, it doesn't matter what it is. She doesn't dance to actual music but when the theme of a TV show plays she jumps off the couch to dance. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","mind_body","I think I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old, I don't really care about the body part so to speak. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","last_sing","The other day I was singing to myself when I was cleaning and I randomly break out into song here and there whenever the moment arises. Just out of fun sometimes I sing a line or two to my wife. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","garden","We have a bunch of plants in and around the house and the house is in the woods so we're surrounded by plants and greenery. "
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","why_studies","It's a good way to pass the time and break up the monotony of the day. Also it's a good way to make some money here and there and let it add up to buy things I want."
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","friend_value","Having someone with shared interests that I can talk to about random topics that aren't always serious. And have someone that I can have fun with."
"R_2fjHsfrapspJUFK","religious","I believe in God but I am becoming more skeptical of religion in the sense that that some people hide behind religion to uphold bigotry and intolerance of other marginalized groups in society. Religion doesn't really seek to advance society rather than keep it repressed. "
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","cute_baby","Seeing a baby laugh is the cutest thing. When they laugh, they usually sound like senior citizens, but as a baby. Babies are sort of like older people, just reversed."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","friend_value","Honest and being comfortable is the most important values in a friendship. If you're comfortable with each other, you don't always have to talk. Just doing small actions says a lot. And if you're honest between each other, there is less of a chance of long term conflicts."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","last_sing","The other day ago I was singing to the music of a song. A few months ago my pops and I worked on a musical piece together - my first. I learned a little about singing and wasn't too bad."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","how_raised","I would want to be trained better in the maths at an earlier age instead of reading all the time. Although I read a lot of science books, I didn't read enough math to help me out later. I would want my parents to be more serious about improving my skill with the maths."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","fire_rescue","That would be my laptop. My laptop has all my artwork on it. I can't let it die in a fire."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","garden","In the front of our house, there is a pear and apple tree. The apple tree gives good apples, not tiny. We have used them in jams."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","why_studies","I need to make money while I'm unemployed, looking for work. So I am grateful I have a chance to make some money on the side with online surveys. Plus, they are usually pretty interesting. "
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","famous","I would like to be famous by people knowing my artwork. I want people to recognize my art, and come to me if they want work done. Furthermore, I want to help out beginner artists so this is one way for me to be famous."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","like_work","I create artwork, primarily illustration based. I also do graphic design work and really love the program Adobe Illustrator. I love my work because I've been doing it since I was very young. I was destined to be an artist."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","religious","I am a spiritually religious person. Primarily I follow a lot of the Gnostic beliefs. Being spiritually religious helps me improve myself as an individual and advocate for peace and unity in the world."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","strangest","My neighbour had her bras splayed across her floor most days. She was a busy woman but sometimes we would get candy from her and we would peer into her living room. We aren't sure why her bras were all over the living room..."
"R_2fLtV2ztJgcNUXL","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30 year old. Although my mind might not develop fully, what's more important is the soul developing. With a body of a 30 year old at 90 years old, I can be active, and still do what I love the most: drawing, without any fear of being bed-ridden. "
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","how_raised","My parents always struggled for money and always worried. I wish they would have understood that all I wanted was time with them. Dad could have worked less."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","fire_rescue","Oh gosh, this is difficult! Do I go practical and save something I need? It's tempting but I think I would save something sentimental. I would probably grab the scrapbook I made of my son's baby pictures. I would hate to lose those memories."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","garden","I don't have any trees, plants, or a garden. I keep thinking about making one in my back yard. It might be fun but I don't have much of a green thumb."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","last_sing","I sing to myself in the car every morning on the way to work. It helps keep me awake! I don't sing to others very often, but my son likes it when I sing the song about monkeys jumping on the bed. "
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","mind_body","I would definitely want the mind of a 30 year old. What good would an awesome body do me when my mind is mush? The only thing it would be good for is great sex."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","why_studies","I do online studies to make extra cash. It is a pretty quick and reliable side hustle. I always think they can be pretty interesting."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","friend_value","I value loyalty and honesty in a friendship more than anything. I want to know that you have my back and will give me good advice. I also want to have similar interests so that we can have fun together."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","strangest","There wasn't much strange about my town! It was pretty conventional to be honest. If it had been stranger, it may have been more interesting!"
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","cute_baby","Aren't most babies adorable? I take that back, some are a little but ugly. Anyway, my son always liked to blow kisses when he was a baby to anyone he saw and I thought it was absolutely precious."
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","famous","I would love to be a famous author. I've always loved writing and I won a few awards when I was younger. I'm so busy though- I have no idea when I could find the time to pursue that dream. "
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","like_work","I work as an administrative assistant at a utility company. I've been there for about 5 years and I really like it. The pay is good and they treat me well. "
"R_2fvctmLNOMrZAtr","religious","I grew up very involved in church, but I don't attend often anymore. I am not sure how I feel about religion sometimes. Nonetheless, I still find myself praying all the time. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","garden","I have a garden. I built some raised garden beds and I'm growing several things.  I just started it this year so I'm still learning, but I love it. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","how_raised","I wouldn't have been raised in church. I hate church. I feel like 18 years of my life were wasted in church. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","religious","I'm not religious at all. I completely disagree with most churches. Also the majority of religious people are bigoted hypocrites. "

"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","last_sing","I sang to myself earlier today. I can't remember when I last sang to someone else. I don't like singing in front of people."
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the obvious racism. The town is somewhat segregated. The cops have killed black people and gotten away with it. It's insanely messed up. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","why_studies","I do these online studies because it's easy. I do the studies because it's extra money in my downtime. That's pretty much it. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","fire_rescue","This might be cheating, but I would save a box full of my records and books. I don't have a lot of keepsakes that I care about. But I definitely love my books and records. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do? Probably when my niece put herself in time out. She was upset that she accidentally killed a roly poly. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","famous","I would not like to be famous. I don't like being the center of attention. Also I like having privacy. "
"R_2mMPttBDE5GRsFr","mind_body","It would depend on how my mind was at 90. If it was really bad, I would choose the mind of a 30 year old. If I could still think clearly and logically, I would choose body. It's not like I would have a full 60 years left anyway. "
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","cute_baby","I've seen a child push a grocery cart. The handle bar was at chin level. The child seemed like a miniature adult."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","how_raised","I wish I had more financial security growing up. There was a lot of pressure to do well because we were not wealthy. I wish English was spoken at home so that my language skills would have been better earlier."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","last_sing","I last sang to myself when I was in the shower. I don't remember what the song was. I do remember that my thoughts immediately jumped to whether anyone could hear. I last sang to someone else in order to ask for help in identifying a song."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","religious","I am not religious. I don't know what comes after death or what is. I don't think people can fully grasp all the information to make a judgment, and I've not heard that any theological issues can be resolved through philosophical arguments."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","garden","I don't have any fruit trees or a garden. I have some cacti. My dad gave them to me as a gift which I won't easily discard. Their presence is noticed whenever I stare away and daydream. Then I am pricked back to attention."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. Dementia is a horrific illness because of the emotional trauma that is suffered. If I had dementia, I would have doubts about whether I could even die in peace."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","like_work","I work in software engineering. I like the logical nature of the work that combines with creativity. I like that what I do has real world applications while software seems abstract and easy to manipulate."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","fire_rescue","I would save my laptop. I have many images, videos and things related to memories stored on that laptop. The cumulative effort that went into recording and storing is high."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","friend_value","I value a friend that is easy to talk to. I value friends with similar ethics and opinions when it comes to fundamental worldview. I value friends that are hardworking and strong willed."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","strangest","There were many strange animals in an area that was more ore less urban. I distinctly remember seeing a nest of rabbits, a wolverine and a snake. I don't know how they got there and didn't see multiple occurrences of these species, so they were isolated sightings."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","famous","I don't want to be famous because I would hate the attention. I think trying to make it in any sort of entertainment business is folly and too much determined by chance. I don't think the fame industry is justified or healthy."
"R_2OMHd7Jie4qAYXG","why_studies","I read some books related to cognitive sciences and felt an interest. I do these studies to see what people in the field are up to. I do these studies when I am sitting for a long time at work with nothing else to do, but new work can come in at any moment."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","how_raised","There are a few things that I would change. One being that, I wish my parents were around more and actually acted like parents. I say that because I had to raise my sister pretty much by myself because my parents were never around."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","fire_rescue","My 14 year old son's medical supplies. I have to save them because without his supplies my son would die. That reason alone is why I would save that instead of anything else."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","cute_baby","That's easy, smile. There is nothing n the world cuter than when a bay smiles or laughs. When babies laugh or smile you can't help but laugh and smile with them."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was several years ago. The last time I sang to someone else was about 3 1/2 years ago when my youngest was born. I don't sing much anymore, because my oldest son sings just about every day."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","why_studies","I do them because I want to help people with research. I also do it because it is some more income. Plus it's a great time killer."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","famous","Yes. Only if it is for finding a cure for an incurable disease. Other than that I don't have the need to be famous."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","friend_value","I value three things in a friendship. One is trustworthiness. Friends can't lie to each other because if they did then they would be like strangers. The second is respect. You can't truly be friends with someone you don't respect. The third is dependability. You have to be able to depend on your friends because if you can't then they are just acquaintances. "
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","garden","No not really. The only plant I have is the celery that I'm regrowing in the window. Idon't really have time for a garden what with the kids and work."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","strangest","Just how backwards it was. The were restaurants that had a bell on the door and if you were not White then you were chased out. If you went to the other side of the railroad tracks and you weren't Black then you got shot. I didn't really like that place much because of all the racism."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","mind_body","The mind. I would like to remain sharp in the mind in my old age. It would be great to have such a good memory in my old age."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","like_work","I own my own sewing business. I like being able to create my own schedule and spend more time with my kids. I also like the fact that I can travel around with my business and not have to worry about job loss."
"R_2OTNuK5v2jY9URL","religious","Yes. Because I believe in God and I want to do everything I can to follow his word. I would rather have something to believe in and not go through my life believing in nothing."

"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","garden","I do not have any of these. But I do like to garden. When I buy a house I will garden."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","how_raised","I would change the confidence. I do not think my parents really gave me a lot. I plan on giving a lot to my kids."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","last_sing","I sang to myself in the shower. I do not sing to other people. I am bad."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","mind_body","I think I would choose the body because I prefer that. I think the mind will stay the same. I would choose this good choice."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","why_studies","I do online studies because I like to learn. I like to work on the laptop. I really do enjoy it."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","cute_baby","I think the cutest thing I have seen a baby do is the laugh. it is very funny. I enjoy listening to it."

"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","fire_rescue","I would save my laptop because my work is on it. If I can not work there is no income. No income is not good."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","friend_value","I value that it gives comfort. I like relationships with people. I really like to help friends."
"R_2P1gviIFoTvKUC2","strangest","I think the strangest thing is that it is a mix of ghetto and wealth. I grew up in a wealthy county. But the town is ghetto."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","like_work","I work for a local start up company that make specialized cattle feeders for farmers and ranchers.  I love being part of a company that is inventing new ways of doing stuff,  And its been fun traveling to new places all the time."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","cute_baby","One of the cutest things that I have seen a baby do was when my baby was just learning to crawl and she crawled over to my dog and layed on him.  She crawled on his back and threw her arms around his neck and just gave him a huge hug.  Then she started using his ears as a teething toy.  He didnt seem to care, he just layed there."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","fire_rescue","The final thing I would grab would be my external hardrive.  I would grab that because it had all of our family photos on it and I would hate to lose all of those memories.  Pretty much all of the memories that I have are on the that hard drive."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","friend_value","I value the companionship the most.  because you always have some one who is there and who will listen to you.  And you can also listen to them.  and most of the time they dont judge you."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","why_studies","I do online studies because I can make a few extra bucks from the comfort of my home.  And I can do them at any time of the day and I am not tied down to a certain schedule.  Also, I like to help students and researchers with their projects."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","garden","I have a garden in my back yard.  My kids and I plant fruits and vegitables every spring.  My kids love to plant tomatos, strawberries, squash, watermelon, okra and many other items."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind.  Whats the point of having the body of a 30 year old if you dont have a decent mind.  I would much rather be able to think then have a nice body.  And I can still teach people what i know."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","how_raised","If I could change something about how I was raised, I would have changed who I lived with.  I would have moved in with my grandparents instead of living with my parents.  Because my grandparents actually cared about me, and my parents only cared about themselves."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","religious","I am not a religious person.  Because I have had enough go wrong in my life that I have lost faith is some invisible being that keeps track of all of us.  If he existed, why do we have mass shooting and deadly storms that kill a lot of people.  what are we going to ""learn"" from these incidents."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","last_sing","I last sang to myself this morning when I was taking a shower.  I last sang to some one else last night, when I was putting my kids to bed.  I dont usually like to sing in front of people."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was having a horse barn next door to my house in the middle of town.  It was nice to grow up next to the animals and learn about them.  It was just odd to have a horse barn next to our house when we lived in town and not in the country."
"R_2P5ryPaEm2o8SXp","famous","I dont think I would like to be famous.  For one thing I dont like to talk in front of people.  Also, I hate being the center of attention.  It would be really hard to have people watching everything I do."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is there are a lot of hippies. The hippie culture is strong where I was raised.  The area takes pride in being ""weird"" and unconventional. The overall feel and culture is different than other places I've lived, so that it probably the most strange thing about it."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","why_studies","I do online studies for a number of reasons. I like to contribute to research. I do studies to pass time and because sometimes they are interesting. I also do online studies to earn extra money. The income I earn from online studies is probably the primary motivation."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","how_raised","If I could change anything about how I was raised I would have had my parents be a bit more lenient and grant me greater independence. I think I would have been better off with a little less guidance. I think I would have learned things on my own better if my parents had let me learn and make mistakes on my own a little bit. I believe this would have helped me become more confident, self sufficient, and prepared."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","garden","Yeah, I have a sort of garden. Our yard isn't too big so I can't really plant crops or anything, but I grow some plants on the deck. Last year I grew tomatoes and a bunch of different herbs like mint, oregano, and basil. I wish the yard was bigger so I could have a full garden or fruit trees."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","like_work","For work I do various tasks in an office setting. I do things like data entry, organization, communication, review, filing, and clerical work. I like that my hours are not too extensive and I have some degree of autonomy and independence on the job. I also enjoy some of my colleagues."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","famous","I would not like to be famous. I don't want to be famous because I don't see the advantages. I don't crave recognition, and I am a private person so I don't want people prying into my life. I prefer to remain more anonymous and out of the spotlight."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","friend_value","In a friendship, I value loyalty and honesty the most. It is impossible to trust someone and maintain a strong relationship if you cannot trust them, so honesty is vital. Loyalty is also important, because friends need to be there for each other. I need to be able to count on my friends the way they know they can count on me. Loyalty and honesty demonstrate that you truly care about the other person, so they are important in a friendship."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","fire_rescue","I would save my computer. It is one of my most valuable possessions. It is not only worth quite a bit of money, but is filled with important documents and information. I also use it to do work, which adds to its value and importance. It is just about the most useful item I own, so I would save it first."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby or child do is eat food in a messy way. I think this can be funny and cute. Babies are usually messy and not very adept with using utensils, so it is entertaining. In general though, I do not find babies or children cute, nor most of the things that they do."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","mind_body","I would want the body of a 30 year old, because I value physical health and being able to stay active. As you get old, just about everyone loses strength and is less physically able. However, it is possible to maintain most or all of your mental capacity as you get old. For this reason, I think keeping the body of a 30 year old would be more beneficial and rewarding."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","religious","I am not a religious person. I was not raised religious, and I believe religion is foolish. There is no logic, evidence, or sound reasoning to suggest that there is a God or that religion is anything other than a made-up set of beliefs and rules. I believe religion causes more conflict than benefit for humanity."
"R_2P83D7oO1tLxGiu","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was last week. I was listening to music and sang along. I don't remember the last time I sang to someone else. I usually don't sing to people because I have a horrible singing voice."
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","cute_baby","My son is now starting to talk either verbally or with signs and yesterday, as I was leaving home for work, he waved good bye to me. The thing that made it cute was him trying to say the words at the same time and how many times he did it. He kept coming as I was walking away to wave good bye and try to say it, and he kept doing it again and again"
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","how_raised","I always think about my past and if I could change anything on the way I was raised, I would have to change my father completely. My father has, from the very early days of my life, been a good example of the type of father I don't want to be. I've never known my father sober or responsible and all his impact on me growing up was affected by that. He almost never participated in the way I was raised except when he'd cause me problems."
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","why_studies","I do these online studies in order to increase my knowledge and/or learn new skills. I've always been fascinated by graphic design and taking these online photoshop and illustrator classes will help me get skills in that field. Online studies make me learn anything at the pace that I'm comfortable with"
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","famous","I would like to be famous as someone who has made a great impact on society. In my career, I have always gravitated towards fields that would allow me to make a difference in creative ways and hopefully change the life of those around me. I'm now a software developer and I would like to be famous for creating a novel program that would be unique and impactful in the lives of the society I live in."
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","strangest","I grew up in a remote place where all the crazy stuff happened. We had many shoplifters in the area and there was always news of people being arrested for that every now and then. We also had many homeless people on the streets so it never was safe to walk alone at night"
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","last_sing","I remember singing to myself last year when I was facing a huge breakup after I had discovered my fiancee had been hiding huge secrets from me. I sang to myself ""Breathe Deep"" by Guy Penrod because it's a soothing song that makes one forget troubles and remember that God is in control. I don't think I have ever sang to someone else except in big groups such as choirs and church congregation"
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","mind_body","I would rather retain the mind of a 30 year old. The thing I have realized is old people with a good mental capacity live longer and are still every bit as sharp, social, friendly as younger people. So having a young mind would definitely make me more of a joy to be around."
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","fire_rescue","After saving my loved ones, the next item I would save is my laptop. I can't picture my life without my laptop because outside of home, my whole life revolves around it. It helps me get my work done and learn new things every day using it."

"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","friend_value","I am very careful choosing friends and I value my friendships a great deal. The thing I value most is honesty. I like a person I can be myself with and don't have to wear a mask and pretend to be someone else. I also like someone who will call me out when I do something wrong and gives me the best advice whenever necessary. All that is only possible through total honesty."
"R_2PpBqDyib2OS3C6","religious","Yes I am a religious person. I'm a religious person because I believe in the God of the universe who created humanity and all that inhabit the earth. I also believe that Christ came and died for us to reunite us with heaven and redeem us from eternal damnation. I believe in His saving grace"

To work on a project, all I need is my laptop and some internet. I don't need to lock myself in a lab or an office to get something done"

"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","religious","Yes I am a religious person.  I grew up in a religious family, going to church every Sunday and on special occasions, being involved with Sunday School and Youth Group and helping out.  I became a Born Again Christian at an early age. There is so much proof that God does exist in the things that I've seen happen."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","last_sing","I last sang to my daughter last night.  She is 5 and loves to be sung to sleep.  She loves Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, so that is what I sang to her."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","how_raised","There is nothing I would change about the way I was raised.  My parents raised me to be a good, honest, ethical person.  I was shown love and was very well taken care of."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","strangest","There wasn't anything really strange about where I grew up.  I grew up in a small town where most people knew each other.  I guess that may be strange now a days, but it was nice.  I loved going anywhere and people watched out for you."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do is watching them draw or color.  I love watching their face and the funny expressions they make while they're drawing.  My kids especially all would twirl their tongue while they were drawing."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is honesty.  It is important to me that my friends are honest with me. It is horrible being lied to, so I choose my friends with care."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","famous","No, I really would not like to be famous.  There is no way in which I would like to be famous. I don't like to be in the spotlight on any occasion. I am a simple, modest person."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","garden","I do not have fruit trees, plants or a garden.  Unfortunately, we live on prairie and it is very dry and the soil is not good for growing anything. If I could, I would love to have all of the above if they would grow here."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","mind_body","I would rather have the mind of a 30 year old.   I would always work out and eat healthy, so as long as my body is healthy that would be great.  But, the mind is more important in retaining.  It would be a nightmare not to remember people or events in my life that were important to me."
"R_2PpyfyIb3NxnpvP","fire_rescue","The one thing I would make a final dash in to save would probably be my purse.  Not only are all of my important financial things in there, but many other things as well. I pretty much keep everything in there but the kitchen sink."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","garden","I love to plant my own fruit and that is why I have an lemon and orange tree. I wish I could have more fruit trees, but the space in my yard is limited. But nothing beats having fresh fruit every season and to be able to give some away to my friends and family."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","how_raised","I would have like to have traveled more as a kid. I fell like our life was too monotonous, and it had no adventure or change. I would like to have had more experiences and seen much more of my surroundings; to have more lasting memories."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","like_work","I am currently a free lance writer, but I work full time also on the side. I love the fact that i am a writer and that i am able to created different stories. I enjoy all aspects of my jobs and I would not change them for anything. The experience that I have developed is priceless."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","famous","No, I would never want to be famous. I would only would like to be famous, is in my line of work and for the good I have done for others. If I were ever to be famous, it would be to spread knowledge to the world of my faith and beliefs, but nothing more."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","friend_value","I value honesty and sincerity, the most in friendship. I know the type of friend I am and I know the type of friend I would like to have. So, I value a friend the fact that we can be honest with each other and sincerely wish and do the best for our friendship to grow as we both grow."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","fire_rescue","That would be a tough one. I would have to say, I would save my purse. My purse has all the things I would need for the aftermath of the situation. Such as my ID and bank cards. Plus i would be able to contact my insurance company and get the process of claims done quicker, by having all the necessary documents with me. "
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","religious","I wouldn't say I am religious buy I do have a confirmed and profound faith in God. The reason why I say I 'm not religious but I believe in God, is because I see God as much more than a religion. I have faith and my faith leads me to know that God is not a religion but a belief. It is the certainty that Jesus is my savior and that He is the leader of my life, without all of the doctrines man has unfortunately made. It is a simple as faith and faith in the word of God."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen, is when my baby brother was brought home. He was the weirdest looking ""alien baby"" as I called him. I used to watch him and just wonder where he came from. Then one day, as I was holding him, he grabbed my ear and wouldn't let go. As he slept he held onto my ear, as if to make sure I wouldn't leave him. It was the cutest thing ever and I always remembered that from that moment on he was cute to me."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","mind_body","I would opt to retain my body of 30, rather than my mind as a 30 year old. Who wouldn't want to maintain their youth and body, and still age mentally. I would have my peak looks, along with my wise and aged mind. It would be the best of both worlds."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","last_sing","I sang to myself this morning, as I got ready for work. I love listening to music to get ready in the morning, so i can't help but sing along. Whether i would sing to someone else, never. Unless,it was for my child, then I would consider it."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","why_studies","To better my understanding of the subject. I don't like to leave any room for error. Therefore, I ensure that i am current in my studies and with the latest investigations, by taking these online studies."
"R_2pRzvQOmY0lkOgN","strangest","The strangest thing would have to be, that my neighborhood was too normal. Nothing really happened much and it was a common place to live. It would have been fun to encounter some strange things, so my childhood could have been more interesting but I guess you always think the grass is greener on the other side."
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","how_raised","If i could change anything about the way I grew up, it would definitely be my families economic status.  My family having more money would halve given me more opportunities that could have impacted my life until this day. life would have been much easier. "
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","fire_rescue","I would not go back for anything else. Why take the risk? Material things ca be replaced, there would be no reason to go back in the home."
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","mind_body","I would like to keep the mind of a 30 year old. What good is a young body if you are mentally incapacitated. I would prefer a clear mind. "
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is laugh. I have seen it a million times, but it always make me smile. Very heart warming. "
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","famous","No, I would not like to be famous. I am not the type of person who likes attention. Fame would take me out of my comfort zone."
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","last_sing","The last time I sung to myself was this morning. I had the radio playing and I sung with the song that was playing. I never sing to anyone else. "
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","garden","I do not have a garden. I also do do not have any fruit trees, but there are plants growing everywhere around my house. Plants grow everywhere."
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","friend_value","The thing I value most in a relationship is honesty. Rather it be good or bad, I would like to know the truth at all times. Honesty is a rare trait these days."
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","why_studies","I do online studies because I find them interesting. The studies also pay for people to them. Which is a win win situation. "
"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","strangest","The strangest thin about where i grew up was the demographics. Pretty much everyone where I grew up was the same race as me. I did not realize this was weird until my family moved to another town."

"R_2QibnuZH1XZQOm6","religious","No,  I am not a religious person. Simply because I believe that science is much more likely to be the truth. Religion is all speculation.  "
"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","religious","Not really I do like going to church, and I miss the traditions of church. The priest at my childhood church really angered and hurt me when I was a single mother. I'm not sure that I'll ever be fully over it. "
"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","cute_baby","My youngest daughter gave the best look to her dad one night. She asked him to be late to work to read her a bedtime story. He put down his things and sat and read to her, and the look she gave him was priceless. I snapped a photo, and it's one of my favorite moments ever. "
"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","garden","Oh, not at all. I have a black thumb and I kill anything that enters our yard. I would love to learn how to be a better gardener, but I just am hopeless. "
"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","fire_rescue","My bug out bag. It has clothes for myself and the kids, as well as my bible. The bible itself isn't as important as what's inside of it. I definitely would try to make sure that I could save what I could. If I could grab one item, I would grab everything I could on my way out. 
"

"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","famous","I wouldn't mind being a celebrated author, but I'm not sure about being necessarily famous. I think when you are famous, you sacrifice a degree of privacy and anonymity. I'm just not sure that I'm okay with that. "
"R_2qlLbMgO1P6SyAR","how_raised","I would change not being mentally, physically, and sexually abused. I would change my mother not being brave enough soon enough to leave my father. And I would change not being involved in physical activities that foster a desire for physical fitness. "

"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","how_raised","I think my parents truly did a great job raising me, but there are plenty of holes in my base-knowledge, most of which are things learned outside of school, by your family. For example I have zero idea how to understand my insurance options and how to make a wise decision. I mean what even is a PPO? Between that and learning how to be financially responsible, I wish they had woven some of those lessons into my life at an early age, or at least explained it all before I left for college! "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","strangest","The neighborhood where I grew up was very quiet, with lots of families and children, and it always felt very safe. The strangest thing by far would be that a high profile murder occurred in the mid-90's, throwing my neighborhood into the national spotlight. It was difficult to tell people where I lived without them immediately saying something along the lines of ""oh did you know Maddie Clifton or Josh Phillips?"" Yes I did but also the neighborhood is wonderful aside from all of that! "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","why_studies","I do these to make more money. You know that working in the non-profit sector is challenging, financially. Even though I am a division manager, I still like to try to make $10 on Mturk each weekday, so $200 a month. My husband jokes that this is my ""wine fund"" and honestly I am okay with viewing it this way! Working for my vices! "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","friend_value","I value loyalty most in a friendship. I find that it is difficult to find another person in life who will have your back and support you no matter what, and that is why I value your friendship so much. It is so important to me to feel fully relaxed and at ease with someone, and for me that only comes with full trust. "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","last_sing","I last sang to myself this morning in the car! I have been so excited for the new TSwift to come out, and of course each song is a banger. My commute the last week or so has been made so much better by this album, because I just belt it out the whole way in to work and the whole way home! I never will sing to anyone else because my voice is truly the worst and I do not want to inflict that on anyone. "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","cute_baby","This is going to sound horrible, I am aware, but the cutest thing I think a baby can do is just topple over. My cousin's son is just learning how to walk, and I have so much fun watching him take a few steps and then just fall right back on his butt. The cutest thing about it is that he is not phased by falling, and he is so eager to get up and get going again! "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","religious","No, I am not religious. Even though I grew up in the Episcopalian church, I truly never believed any of the teachings. I learned so much about how to be a good person and whatnot, but the biblical side of things I found just too far-fetched. As I grew up and learned more about science and the universe, my ideals regarding religion completely shifted. I have considered myself an atheist for over a decade now. "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","famous","Sometimes I think it would be nice to be famous, just for the wealth and being able to live a creative lifestyle. However I think it would be exhausting. I am a private person and I would hate to constantly feel watched or followed, and have my every move reported on. That just cannot be a mentally healthy way of living after some time. "

I have a really hard time with plants because I easily forget to take care of them and they die. The herb garden and bushes on the balcony are not doing well at all, but my succulents are flourishing! They have grown to the point where I need to re-pot them soon, but of course I am just too lazy. Gardening is just not for me! "

The organization advocates for the preservation of historical properties, and the funds I raise go immediately to protect these places and advocate for better tax credit laws. I really like this organization before the work we do is physical and concrete. It is truly wonderful to visit a site and think ""we did this. We kept this wonderful place here."""
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","mind_body","I would definitely want to only maintain the body of a 30-year-old. I can't imagine basically freezing your maturity and knowledge at 30 and never learning or growing past that. I would not want to be an old lady with the brain of a young woman. "
"R_2QzBYTVOmc6QgGI","fire_rescue","My husband and I keep an accordion folder of all of our important documents and also important nostalgia items. These include photos, birthday cards, mementos from our wedding, and the like. I put everything like this in one place just for the event that I can only grab one thing to save in a fire. I would absolutely hate to lose all of my belongings, but making sure all of our legal documents and wedding things are safe would feel like a small win. "
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","garden","In the past, when I was a homeowner, I had plants and a vegetable garden. I have always enjoyed working outside and took much pride in my ability to grow vegetables. As I am currently a renter, I do not have any type of fruit trees or plants. I have been tempted to grow a vegetable garden, but have yet to make the effort."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","mind_body","If I were given a choice of retaining my mind or my body at the age of 90, I would have to choose my mind, especially if I had the sharp mind of a 30 year old. I believe that what the mind can believe, the body can achieve. I feel that having a sharp mind vs. having a buffed body would better suit my needs. I feel that at the age of 63, I continue to have a sharp mind, even though the body can sometimes disappoint me."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","last_sing","The last time a sang to myself was yesterday while I was driving my car. I sang ""Let's Hang On"" which was a remake by the Manhattan Transfer. The last time I sang to someone else was when I sang to my partner of many years. I can't actually remember the title of the song."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I would want to change the mindset of my parents and siblings regarding their homophobic attitudes and beliefs. My parents and my siblings were not supportive of my lifestyle and thought that I was a sick person. They did not understand something that I could not even explain to them. I just tried to convince family that being gay was not a choice. "
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","strangest","I think the strangest thing about where I grew up would be the mentality of the townspeople at that time. I grew up as a child in the early 60's at a time when many beliefs and attitudes were wrong or sinful. Being a child who was struggling with my sexuality, it was most difficult to live the life I needed to live around the people of my community. I lived my life in secrecy and solitude that had a profound effect on my childhood."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","like_work","When I was working, I most recently was a private duty caregiver for an elderly lady with dementia. I learned so much about life and living. She taught me the importance of growing older gracefully and with dignity and accepting death as a transition into something better. She knew how to face death and not be afraid."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","friend_value","I most value the closeness and openness of having a friend that I can confide my deepest secrets with. It is so necessary to have someone to talk with regarding the ups and downs that we experience in our lives. Having a friend that I trust completely makes me feel very supported and loved. These are two attributes of a friendship that help me through the difficult times in my life. "
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","religious","I do not consider myself to be a religious person. I do not participate in any type of formal religious activities as attending church services on a regular basis. I do not feel that going to church is going to make me any better of a person. I can have a close relationship with my Maker without the structured activities established  by the church."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","famous","I can honestly state that I would not want to be a famous individual. I think it would be very hard to live your life as you would be under a microscope with everyone looking at you and watching every move that you made. If I were famous at all, it would be because of my willingness to help others by providing financial assistance. Being a millionaire would probably make me famous and I would certainly want to pay back to my family and friends what had been given to me."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","fire_rescue","Should my home be on fire, I think I would make one more mad dash into the flames to retrieve my musical instrument/flute. Playing flute over the years has been very therapeutic for me and I would miss the opportunity to play for others. The flute I own now has an attachment to a dear friend who bought the instrument for me. I would want to continue playing flute as an outlet for loosing my other possessions in a house fire."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","cute_baby","I think the cutest thing I have seen a baby do would be to pass gas and then produce an award winning smile. Perhaps the child smiles because they feel better by not having the added gas pressure or it could be that the child likes the sound of passing gas. Either way, I find the child to be most cute and entertaining."
"R_2R1wNRztVHTTrtE","why_studies","I do online studies for several reasons. The first reason being that I get paid a monetary fee for my services. Secondly, I complete online studies because I find some of the studies to be quite interesting and entertaining. I feel that doing surveys helps me to keep my brain active, which is good for someone like me at the age of 63. Lastly, I would say that I complete online studies simply because I enjoy doing so."

"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","garden","Absolutely! I have a garden in my back yard that I use to grow pumpkins, different spices and I even grow tomatoes. I tend to it every single day and I love it to pieces. I will say however that sometimes the weeds can be a pain in the butt and sometimes I spend more time than I want to trying to get rid of them.

"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","mind_body","I think I would like to retain the body of a 30 year old. I would hate to have my body fail me as I got older and that would be kind of scary. I do love the thought of becoming wiser and smarter as I age though. I really feel like as I have gotten older, I have learned a lot more and I really enjoy becoming smarter."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","why_studies","I do them because sometimes I have some downtime and I am looking for something to keep me busy. Having a little extra cash here and there isn't really a bad thing either. Overall, I guess I just like keeping busy and doing these studies allows me to do just that."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","how_raised","I would probably say that sometimes I just need to let things go. I will get started on a project and I CANNOT stop unless I finish it. I literally mean that if I am suppose to go to bed at 10pm to make sure I am awake in time for work the next morning, I will stay up until 1am still working on what I started. I just have to let stuff go sometimes and realize I can work on it later."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","last_sing","I don't ever sing to myself because I don't really listen to or think about much too much, especially when I am alone. However, there are times when my niece will sing something or play some music and it will sound kind of catchy and I will sing along with her."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","cute_baby","I would probably say the cutest thing i've seen a baby do was give me a really cute raised eyebrow look and then give me a thumbs up. I don't even think the baby realized what she was doing but it was absolutely funny! I really think maybe the thumbs up was just a mistake but it sure worked well with the raised eyebrow! "
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","famous","I definitely would not like to be famous. I don't really like the idea of people constantly trying to invade my personal space or being on my property trying to catch a glimpse of me. I really feel like I wouldn't be able to live a normal life ever again if I became famous."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","friend_value","I think overall I value loyalty first and honesty second but the race is real close. Loyalty and honesty help make an amazing relationship between 2 people. Being able to openly tell people what is on your mind is great, especially when you aren't afraid of being judged. Being loyal to your loved ones means you never have to worry about being abandoned and you can count on them when you need them."
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","fire_rescue","I would probably save my computer. I would do so because it has a lot of history with me and has a lot of photos and everything I have saved up over the years. It would be like losing your memory and not remembering anything. It would definitely be a sad day. Maybe I should create more backups?"
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","strangest","I live in a smaller town and we have a sugar factory not too far away. Every single fall season the entire town will fill up with this totally awful nasty rancid smell that completely consumes anything and everything! It smells like a really nasty but sweet smelling fart. It is weird to explain but totally makes sense once you smell it!"
"R_2rGkbiC2HY6kcwd","like_work","I do IT Support for my local hospital branch. I don't mind it so much. I like that I can help keep everything running smoothly that way no patient has any issues with records. I do like that I get to work with computers and I am glad that I have this kind of job."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind. I have seen both mental deterioration and physical deterioration in my grandparents, and seeing the changes that a person and their family go through when experiencing mental issues is terrible. I would rather stay mentally sharp."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","why_studies","I complete online studies to earn a little extra income to supplement the salary that I make at my full time job. Spending just an hour or so a day completing online studies can add up to over $100 a month. That could pay for a couple of monthly bills, fill up my gas tank a few times, or would make for a fancy dinner out with my wife. It's worth it, and they're interesting."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","last_sing","I don't really remember the last time I sang to myself. I usually sing while completing housework, or when I'm home alone and can blast any music I want to. I remember singing to my wife a few days ago, but I can't really remember the specific circumstances."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that it was in a relatively lower-class part of an upscale suburb. The children I grew up with all came from a similar social class, since we all lived in the same apartment complex, but we all felt out of place in school with mostly rich kids. It caused me to become closer with my neighbors and we developed a nice social network."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","friend_value","I value honesty, loyalty, and a sense of humor above all other things when thinking about a friendship. I've been fortunate enough in life that I have a large group of friends that I can turn to in times of need. They exhibit these qualities perfectly, and I do my best to reciprocate those attributes."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","famous","I would like to be famous in a way that changes the world for the better. It's easy to become famous nowadays, making it as simple as creating a YouTube channel. I would rather be known for making a contribution to my professional field and making peoples' lives better."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","like_work","I work in higher education, helping connect college students in need of assistance with resources that can help get them through tough times. The work is very rewarding. It feels great to be able to make a positive impact in the life of another person."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","fire_rescue","I would probably try and save a large box that contains all of our old family photographs. Everything else in the house can be replaced, but those memories can't. The box is large enough to make escaping the burning house awkward and difficult, but I would certainly try to save it if I had the time."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","religious","I am not a religious person, though I consider myself to be culturally Jewish. I consider myself to be too realistic of a person to be religious, and am more comfortable living in the here and now rather than seeing life as a test to see what happens to me after I die. This has put me at odds with some of my more religious family members."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden in my home. Since I live in a desert climate, it's difficult to grow these items. Even if it were possible to grow a garden, I don't think I'm skilled enough to actually have these plants thrive."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","how_raised","I would probably not go through my childhood thinking that my grades were the end-all-be-all and that if I didn't get all As, then my life would somehow be destined for failure. I spent many days stressing over insignificant details which led to my constantly getting sick. A lot of this pressure came from my parents, who meant well."
"R_2ru9TRaWmlwV2DN","cute_baby","When my nephew was about two years old, he crawled over to where my brother-in-law and me were having a conversation. He began pulling at my jeans as if to take me somewhere. I let him pull me to where he wanted to go, which ended up being his play area. When we got there, he threw a ball at me, wanting to try and play catch. It was really cute."
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","how_raised","I wish that my parents would have allowed me to fail a little bit more.  They were great parents and I love them dearly, but there were times looking back that they didn't allow me to fail and learn from my mistakes.  I think that hasn't necessarily served me very well in my recent past as I'm not used to failure and how to handle it. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","last_sing","I sing in the shower and in the car on almost a daily basis.  I probably sang to someone the last time I was really drunk as I'm not a very good singer and don't like to sing in front of people.  However, when I get drunk my inhibitions are lowered and I've been known to sing when with my friends. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","like_work","I am a teacher and for the most part I really enjoy my job.  There are a couple of things that I don't care for however, chief amongst those being that children tend to be very disrespectful and can be confrontational for no apparent reason.  I also dislike having to deal with parents of students who think that there child has never done anything wrong in their lives and they are without blame in any situation. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","why_studies","I mainly do them to get some extra spending money.  I'm able to do them enough that I'm able to take a vacation each year from only my turking money and I'm able to put the rest of my money into savings.  It truly has made a large difference in my life. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that we call ""Duck, duck, goose"" ""Duck, duck, grey duck.""  I'm from Minnesota and from what I have heard we are the only place in the country that calls it by that name.  I've had arguments with others over the proper name of the game. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","mind_body","I think that I would like to have the body of a 30 year old for the rest of my life.  My family has a history of keeping their mental facilities well into their 90's so I have a good chance to have a sound mind at that age.  I would want to be able to take advantage of the time that I had to be able to explore and not be held back by physical limitations. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","fire_rescue","I would save my computer.  I use it all the time and, though I hate to say it, I would be lost without it.  I don't really own any sentimental items that I would save so I would save the most valuable personal possession that I have. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","famous","I really don't think I'd want to be famous.  I enjoy the anonymity that I have and I feel that if I were famous, I wouldn't be able to go out and do simple things like enjoy a meal at a restaurant or go to a movie.  I would like the riches part that usually comes with fame, but I don't know that even that would be worth the lack of privacy that you would have to endure. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","garden","One of my roommates has a little vegetable garden, but I don't have anything to with it.  I have never really been interested in gardening at all.  I would occasionally help my mom in her garden growing up, but I never really cared for it. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","religious","I haven't been a religious person since I was a child.  I went through all the motions and was confirmed in my church when I was 15.  At that point my parents gave me the option of continuing to go to church or not and I chose fairly quickly that I had no interest in continuing to go.  I have just never truly believed in the story of Jesus, God, and the Bible.  I think that there are many valuable lessons that can be learned through religion, but many of the tenants of religion I cannot get behind. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","cute_baby","I think that interactions between babies and animals is super cute.  I have found myself watching YouTube videos of this for longer than I'd care to admit.  They just seem like they connect on a level that older humans don't with animals. "
"R_2rVoXAzLMjP55FS","friend_value","I value loyalty and honesty the most in my friendships.  If I don't trust someone I find it difficult to want to be around them a lot.  I've had friends who after awhile I couldn't trust to tell me the truth and I stopped hanging out with them.  I think that it is vital to be honest in all relationships and I can't stand being around people that are prone to BS. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","mind_body","I would rather have the body of a 30-year old.  I would want the body so I could continue to play sports.  I would also want it for dating purposes. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","cute_baby","I once saw a baby hug a puppy.  "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","fire_rescue","I would save my piano.  I love to play the instrument.  I have been played to play before and wish to continue. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","how_raised","I would like to have had a different father.  My father was not around a lot.  This is a huge regret in my life. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","garden","I do not have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden.  Do you have any?"
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","last_sing","I last sang in the shower.  I last sang to someone last night.  I sang to my girlfriend.  Both times, I sang the same song. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","famous","I would not want to be famous.  I do not wish to have the attention.  I would only want to be well known to my future generations.  "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","religious","I am not a religious person.  I find it all to be a hoax.  I fear religion is used to control people."
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","friend_value","I value honest most in a relationship.  I look for a friend I can trust.  I want to be able to tell my personal secrets to them. "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","like_work","I am a teacher and I like helping students achieve their dreams."
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","strangest","The old creek was the strangest thing.  It was a creek that was rumored to be wicked.  I heard that there was a wizard that put a curse on the creek.  "
"R_2RX2s8LG37aqCev","why_studies","I do these studies for a little extra pocket money.  I like the calmness of the studies.  I also like to be able to afford more things.  "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","famous","I would like to be famous, but not for socially acceptable reasons. There was an infamous man in Russia, I forgot his name, who made a career out of assassinating the mob bosses and high ranking criminals that were ruining his country, and escaping jail time and time again so he could keep doing it. Before he died, he did away with 30 mafia men and caused the collapse of multiple criminal organizations. That's the kind of famous I would like to be."
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","mind_body","I would choose to retain my body. I ain't using my mind for much, anyway. Besides, if I could keep a young body then it'd be a hell of a lot easier to keep a sharp mind. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","fire_rescue","My laptop. It contains all of my important files, including ones that have a lot of sentimental value. Plus, I need it for work. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","friend_value","Loyalty. Honesty. Sincerity. Really, I think those just about cover it. It says enough. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","garden","Yes, do have an apple tree in my back yard. Unfortunately I never really make any use of the apples. I would like to start a garden next year. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","like_work","I answer surveys like this one, and other HIT related stuff. It's not great, my income is pretty low. Luckily for me though, I live in a rather cheap area, so I get by well enough. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","last_sing","I've never really sung to myself. I know I've never sung to anyone else. I don't have a good singing voice, but I would like to learn how to sing well one day. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","cute_baby","I can't really say I've seen a baby or child do anything cute enough for me to remember. It's been a long time since I've been around kids or anyone who had kids. My older sister had kids recently, but she lives out of state and far away. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","strangest","I lived in a ghetto. It was in a poor part of a town that was not known for being poor. My neighbors would host dog fights out of their back yard and the police would never do anything about it. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","why_studies","To make money mostly. I don't have a formal job, so I need to do what I can to earn money. Luckily for me, I'm good at finding and doing these, so I've carved out a decent niche for myself. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","religious","No, I wasn't raised in a religious household. Though I live in a religious area, it's never had much of an influence on my life. I feel if I took an effort to truly understand religion better, though, that I may just convert. I've had strange and powerful dreams that have influenced my view of the world. "
"R_2SBUIkgVbDj6TqX","how_raised","I wish my mom wouldn't have been so incompetent. I love her and I know she tries her best, but she was utterly clueless about many things. I missed out on a lot due to how I was raised. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","friend_value","The companionship or ""just hanging out"" would be the main reason.  I love to just talk with someone of a similar background and interests.  I also learn a great deal from others.  There is a need for love and companionship for most people and I am no exception. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","fire_rescue","I would have to say my trust laptop would be the first thing on my mind.  It has a lot of valuable data and other irreplaceable things.  My backup would be in the house as well on a desktop computer. I really need to go to cloud storage at some point. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","famous","I would like to be famous although not to the point that I'm hounded by fans and paparazzi.  I would like to be know as making a great contribution to engineer or science.  I admire people like Eisenstein and many to others for their intellectual ability and hard work. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","like_work","I work for a major company that manufactures aircraft.  I am in research and development.  Most of the work is very interesting and I like the combination of engineering and IT.  It keep my mind alert and I like to come up with new ideas."
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","why_studies","I do online studies to make use of time.  I am attempting to be productive while I am waiting at home for something or bored on a day off.  Many of them are interesting and the extra money doesn't hurt. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","last_sing","I can't remember singing to anyone unless it was when my kids were little.  I do sing occasionally to myself when mowing on a riding mower.  The sound of the mower downs out my inability to sing well. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","mind_body","I would rather have the body of a 30 year-old.  I would rather retain the knowledge I have gained over my 90 years while having the health of someone 30.  I see this as the best of both worlds."
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","religious","I am not into ""organized"" religion although I am a Catholic  I think describing me as ""spiritual"" may be a better way to put it.  I do believe that there is a higher power but that higher power may very well be in many different religions.  I do not like man-made dogma and silly rules. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","strangest","I grew up in many different places.  One common thread is that people have different dialects depending on where you live.   The south is much different that the north.  People are basically the same but how they say things and the words they use can sometimes be strange to the newcomer. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","cute_baby","That's a hard one.  Our kids did many cute things.  One that I do remember is my daughter when she was two or three.  She used to put her little feet into my wife's high heals and attempt to walk around.  It was funny and I knew she was going to be into fashion. "
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","garden","I don't have a garden or fruit trees although that would be nice.  I do have a few house plants.  I don't exactly have a ""green thumb"" so gardening isn't my strong suit. I would like to learn more about fruit trees.  I have better luck with trees."
"R_2SGJnzNbctK2MAe","how_raised","It would have been nice to have more money and resources.  My parents kind of struggled in that way but they were good parents.  It would have been nice to go to nicer schools and be in a better neighborhood. "
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","strangest","Probably that there were three diners in a town of less than 20,000 people. I always found that to be quite odd. What made it even more strange is that this was very much a suburban area with not much going on."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","friend_value","I value trust more than anything. If I can not trust a friend with my thoughts and problems, then he is not much of a friend. Without trust, there can be no friendship, in my opinion."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","famous","I wouldn't mind being famous for a short period of time, perhaps 3-5 years or so. I think living the life of a young male movie star in his prime such as Leonardo DiCaprio would be amazing. Not only would I enjoy all the women, the money and fame would be fantastic as well."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","cute_baby","The cutest thing I see babies do is when they furiously kick their legs as if they are exercising. This is usually accompanied with a giggle or laugh and it gets me every time. They usually do this because they get excited or anxious about something. It's incredibly cute."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","why_studies","I have some downtime throughout the day and need a way to unwind. I do not play video games anymore, but I still need a way to keep my brain stimulated, even in said downtime. I find these studies accomplish what I am looking for."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","mind_body","I would prefer the body of a 30-year-old. I am an active person and would love it if I could stay active for those last 60 years. I feel that the mind doesn't deteriorate anywhere near as quickly as the body does. "
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","fire_rescue","My computer. There is more important information on there than in anything else I can think of. Losing my computer in a fire would be fairly disastrous for me. I would save my computer over even a watch that was significantly more expensive."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","garden","I live in a high-rise in the city, so this is not possible for me. Perhaps if I lived in a rural area I would consider this. For now, I simply enjoy visiting family in Greece where they do indeed have fruit trees and gardens that I can enjoy."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","how_raised","I think I would have preferred to have been raised with a less emphasis on a college education. I was taught that one *must* go to University else they would never succeed in life, and I know this not to be true at all. Had I been made aware of the many options besides college, I would have perhaps taken a different path."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","last_sing","I last sang to myself probably last night while listening to music. I do this sometimes when trying to fall asleep. I don't ever sing to other people as my singing voice is not exactly one that I am proud of."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","like_work","I am a self-employed cryptocurrency trader. I mostly love the freedom it gives me to set my own hours. I also do not have to answer to anyone, which is something that I really value. Working out of my own home is another plus."
"R_2Sq8945H8ZIhtg4","religious","I am Agnostic so I am not a religious person. I don't share the same beliefs and values of the very religious. I believe most religions are more like cults, and consider the people in these cults to be quite annoying, to put it mildly."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","how_raised","My Dad was NYPD and had a strict view of the world. I grew up during the sixties and seventies and long hair was the given style. As a cop my Dad somehow saw hair length as a sign of disrespect to him and law enforcement in general. His concern was ""what would people think.' It made absolutely no sense at all but resulted in constant battles over my hair length which he mostly won and set me up to look different than most of my friends."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","like_work","I am retired but previously I worked in developing decision support models for 2 airlines and an equipment rental company. The major areas were price optimization, resource allocation and facility design. When I started I was a developer and rose as high as CIO.  I like the positions where I did the work better than the ones where I managed people. I just like math, numbers and coding better the reviewing other peoples work and writing performance reviews and weekly reports."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","garden","We have a two acre backyard and we have a small section to grow fruits. We have a peach tree, a plum tree and blueberry bushes. The peach tree in particular produces lots of fruit. I have to spray these trees to keep away insects and present various diseases from affecting the crop. The biggest issue I have is with birds or some other animal stealing the peaches before they ripen. Next year I am thinking about getting a net to cover the tree or some other devices to scare away the thieves."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","strangest","I grew up in the Bronx, NY.  Everything was jammed in, made of concrete and there were no parks or grass to be found in the immediate neighborhood. However my friends and I still found ways to play baseball in the street and in the local school yards. This took on various forms, such as stick ball, punch ball, slap ball and stoop ball. It wasn't real base ball which we called hard ball but it was a lot of fun even if it pissed off the neighbors and broke an occasional window."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","famous","Not really. If you are very famous annoying people take unsolicited pictures of you and your family and write stupid biased articles about you.  Assuming this is a successful actor or politician hell no, I prefer my privacy. If it was being a star baseball player I would have to think about it."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","fire_rescue","I would go get my gun so I could shoot whoever set the fire.  We would also need it for protection while we are on the street without shelter. I would grab several magazine and boxes of ammo while I was at it. I know you only said one item but they all together in the safe and the gun without magazines is worthless. We live is a rural area so who knows how long it will take for the police to arrive"
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","religious","No but I do believe in God. I look around at the green grass, blue sky and all the wonderful creatures on earth and have a hard time imagining that this all came about by the random permutations of evolution over a very long time.  It makes more sense to me that someone created it using evolution as the catalyst. On the other hand organized religion just has a bunch more crazy rules and mythology that also make no sense. I know right from wrong and  don't need more rules on top of all the crap we already get from government and culture. Anyone I don't know the answer to creation and neither do you or anybody else. I am not going to get all worked up over something I can't possibly know or do anything about."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","why_studies","Because I am retired and doing these things are fun for me plus I pick up pocket change.  You could never make a living doing this and if I was still working I wouldn't have the available time. In particular I like doing the ones from academia so I can tell college professors and their students how wrong they are about everything and they have to pay me for it. I hope it helps them see a view of the world from someone outside their bubble."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","mind_body","My mind has been pretty good at all ages so I think I would prefer my 30 year old body. I am over 60 and I can already start for feel the affects of physical decline. The brain is still about the same. However if the choice is between being able to do hand flips at 90 but not being able to remember my name, my family members or where I live than I want my 30 year old brain. This really is a stupid question."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","cute_baby","When we lived in Chicago we had a house with a long hallway that ran the length of the structure leading to the garage door. Every day when I came home from work my daughter would start screaming at one end of that hallway and run the length of it as I entered the house. When she reached my she would jump up in arms and say welcome Daddy as I caught her.  Both our children have done lots of cute things growing up but needless to say I loved that run and catch.  It beat making the winning TD catch in football"
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","friend_value","I don't really value friendship very much and I generally like being independent. Now my wife is my best friend and from that perspective, friendship gives me someone to share my life with and talk about things when I need another opinion. It also gives me someone to go out and do things with."
"R_2sRZ7LGYKKeU5tb","last_sing","I sing to myself all the time but not at all to other people except to my wife. I sing because I am usually happy and I like to sing rhymes that make fun of wife.  I probably was singing 5 minutes before meeting you and definitely in the shower this morning."
"R_2sT1a198vt5sbiD","why_studies","I do these online studies to make some extra money. I need to be able to pay my health insurance premiums, and other expenses. I'm afraid I don't have the confidence to go out into the workforce at this point in my life."
"R_2sT1a198vt5sbiD","mind_body","I'd definitely want to maintain my mind. Currently, I love to tat (a form of lacemaking) and would like to be able to do this for a very long time. If I didn't have my mental faculties, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to enjoy my craft anymore!"
"R_2sT1a198vt5sbiD","friend_value","The willingness to hear what I have to say without judging me. I grew up in a family that always made fun of each other and liked to throw around the words ""idiot"" and ""stupid"". If I ever tried to open up, I was screamed at for hours, until I became silent. "

"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","garden","I live in an apartment complex, so I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden. I really wish I did though. If I could, I would love an avocado tree, as well as guava."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","friend_value","I value loyalty more than anything. I think have a friend there, no matter what is a comforting feeling and it means the most to me. I like knowing I will have someone to turn to in times of stress."

"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","how_raised","I wouldn't want to have been raised religiously. I would have also have like more music in the house. With that in mind, I would have liked for my parents to have pushed a musical instrument on my at an early age."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","fire_rescue","I would grab my family photographs. I would try to grab my birth certificate and social security card. If there was enough time, I would grab as many of my vinyl records as I possibly could."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","why_studies","These online studies don't take up a lot of your time, overall. It's a great sources for income, as well. If you have credit card bills, like me, online studies are a great help."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous. Of course, I would love the wealth, but I would like constantly being recognized. I'm not a very social person, so I think it would weird me out too much."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","cute_baby","I think babies, just being babies is cute, in itself. I think watching a baby laugh is extremely innocent and cute. I think watching babies playing with animals is also adorable."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","strangest","I grew up in a rough neighborhood, so I would sometimes have gang members approaching me at a very young age. I thought it was strange in my innocent mind, because I came from a sheltered family and thought I was too young for that type of life. Overall, I remember seeing a lot of strange encounters like this."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","religious","I'm not a religious person, at all. I grew in a religious family, but it never really worked for me. I guess I would consider myself more of a spiritual person."
"R_2uD3dtJZSzGIFv7","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind. I wouldn't want to be senile with a healthy body. That just wouldn't make sense. I would just want to stay sharp at an older age. "
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","garden","Unfortunately, I do not have any of the sort. The closest thing to that is a basil plant, which is dried out. I do not have a green thumb. I would love to have one, once I have a stable place I can call my own. Right now, we are living in my Mom's condo, so I don't have that ability. "
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","fire_rescue","To be practical, I would try to find the file with our birth certificates, social security cards and any other important papers. I'd also grab the painting that my father made of me when I was pregnant."
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","cute_baby","Ok, you're going to get a biased answer from me, since I have children of my own. Anything they do is very cute. I was never a baby person, until I had my own, so as a result, I do appreciate what little ones do. Of course, they don't hold a candle to my kids. Sometimes, even an innocent question sends me over the top of precious exclamation. For instance, seeing my four year old son hold the door open for his grandmother is very cute!"
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","mind_body","Either of them could be good. Considering my genes are prone to Alzheimer's, I would take the former of the two. I couldn't imagine losing my mind and having a 30 year old body, since it wouldn't do me any good to appreciate the body I do have. In fact, I could most likely get into more trouble than if I had to stay in bed. If my mind was still young, then I could possibly use that to keep my body young through exercise and diet."
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","famous","I used to think I'd want to be a famous actress or singer, but the industry is fairly sickening. So I suppose if I were to become famous, it would be to allow the common people to feel better about themselves. Some way which shows that integrity and virtue is something to be desired. "
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","strangest","I'm not certain if this is strange, but where I grew up wasn't full of other kids my age. There were only a couple, so I didn't have the great experience of running to my girlfriend's house to try on clothes and make-up. I recall one Halloween, I was 14, my friend came over and we trick-or-treated. There were no other kids, so either nobody had candy or they practically gave us their whole bowl."

"
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","religious","I am not a religious person. I do not believe in religion. Religion is a man-made thing that I do not trust. I do believe in God, however. He created us without a bible tethered to our bodies. Or maybe he did, but it is called intuition. This is something I am still figuring out. "
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","why_studies","Well, first of all, it is a good way to make some money in between jobs. Another reason, is that it is cool to know that I am making a difference in this world by allowing students to analyze why people do the things they do. I really enjoy the controversial studies where I can express how I feel about what is happening in the world these days. It's better here, than on my facebook page."
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","how_raised","Wow, this is a hard one. Sometimes, I wish I were raised differently because then  my life now would probably be a little easier. Like, if my parents paid for my college and boarding, then I probably wouldn't have dropped out and I'd be more successful now. But then, I think about how humble and more appreciative of things that I am now, since I earn what I do have, so I wonder if I would change anything at all."
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was probably last night. It usually happens when I'm cooking and cleaning. I like to make up silly songs and irritate my children. The cute thing is that sometimes my son sings along with them. "
"R_2uKfWGlG6ZB7ik6","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is the comfort of being able to be myself and to be understood by that friend. I also like for my friend to feel the same way in return. We can be free to express ourselves in any way possible, without having to worry if we are offending them because we both trust that the other wouldn't desire to do such a thing."
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","friend_value","I value trust in friendship which could also be equal to loyalty. If I can't trust you as a friend, then you might as well be an enemy. Who needs enemies when you have friends you can't trust. The very definition of a ""friend"" would be someone you can trust. You can't trust very many people in the World nowadays."
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","fire_rescue","I have to say I need to save the little cash money I have in the house. If we have no place to stay, then we need money to pay for a hotel. Sorry, I have nothing of sentimental value in the house. There are a couple of hard drives with saved work for our small business if I know there is no cash in the house."

"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","how_raised","I don't regret being raised in a lower than average income household. I also don't regret living in a mixed, sort of gang area. I would have rather had a parent around after school instead of being a latch key kid. We probably had too much freedom in the afternoons."
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","religious","Yes, I don't know how someone could not see that God created this World. Some still think there is no God, that everything just happened by chance, we came from bacteria etc. I'm sorry, but is that even possible by looking at how everything works, the oxygen, the movement of the planets? Do you know about the Moon's dimensions in relation to the Earth. Just start with the Moon."
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","last_sing","I sing to myself everyday, not to others. I sometimes sing to my dogs when I am in the mood. I'll make up my own words and usually go off an old classic from the movies of the 60's like Mary Poppins or something similar."
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","mind_body","You better believe you want the mind. All of your friends who are still alive won't have the body either and they probably won't have the mind. With the mind you can still hold a conversation, play a game, watch the news and stay updated. Nobody wants to be the ""dumb jock"", they want to be the ""smart jock"" or even just ""smart"". Am I wrong?"
"R_2uUKyII0bXpecBS","strangest","According to what people knew about the area previously to us moving there, it was ok. Later we find out the kids turned out to be ruthless gang bangers. I had about 3 friends who were shot before they reached the 8th grade. High School got worse but fortunately I transferred to another school for my Sophomore year."

"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","why_studies","I do it for extra income. I like that I can make money in my own free time. I can sort of make as little or as much as I want, depending on how many hours I put into it. It is sometimes fun as well."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","how_raised","If I could change anything, I would change that my dad was an alcoholic. He was a mean drunk. He never did anything for us kids, other than bring home a paycheck. My mother did all of the child raising, and we have a very strained relationship with our father because of this."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","garden","We do have some fruit trees and plants. I would like to have more. We have 15 acres and we could grow more of our own food if we wanted to. They can be a lot of work."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","mind_body","I would prefer to have the mind of a 30 year old. I would hate to have dementia or anything of that sort. I've known people with it, and it makes life not worth living. I think I would rather have a broke down body than a broke down mind."

"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","strangest","The strangest thing is I remember it being picturesque. I felt like it was the most awesome place ever. The funny thing is when I go back on it now, the town wasn't that great. It wasn't horrible, but not as great as I pegged it being as a child."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","friend_value","I value loyalty. I hate being the only one giving 100% in a friendship. I am willing to do anything for a friend, but feel like it's hard to get the same respect in return."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","famous","I would not like to be famous. I do not like the limelight. I do not like being under a microscope. If I were to be famous, it would be for doing something really amazing. I would like to cure cancer or something else like that."
"R_2UVhmLuionhQ9Ng","religious","I am a semi-religious person. I do believe in God, Heaven, and Hell. I do not believe that you must go to church to be 'religious' or have God accept you. I think that God loves anyone who is a good person, regardless of their affiliation with a church."
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","fire_rescue","I would save my nephews pictures that he drew me. That's because they represent a part of his life that I really enjoyed and they symbolize that period of his life. Also because I really don't own anything else that's that special to me. "
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","strangest","One of the strangest things about where I grew up is that it's an old town but it tries to be modern at the same time. So you see alot of elderly people and preserved areas and buildings, but then right across the street, you see some chain store that just opened up. It's a weird mix, almost like being in a time machine. "

"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","how_raised","I would rather have been raised much less conventionally and without so much regard for authority. I would rather have been allowed to be self-regulating, determining my own hours for sleeping and eating, and been home-schooled. I would have also been raised on a healthier diet."
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the shower this morning. I really prefer doing it that activity alone, and I love the acoustics in the bathroom. But I did sing to someone just a few days ago, if you call that singing - I wasn't very serious."

"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","famous","I don't care about being famous at all. That's just dependency on others for approval, and to feed your ego. If I'm really doing what I'm meant to do in life, fame isn't useful to me. "
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","friend_value","What I value mostly in friendship is intimacy. The unique ability to open up to another person and share the journey of life mutually is on incredible importance and value to me. I also value the ability to exchange views on life because it increases my awareness and intelligence."
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","religious","I'm a very religious person, because I feel that there's more to life than just the mundane atmosphere that we live in. Being religious inspires me to be more aware, more contemplative and more loving. It's my preferred mode of life that seems more sensible than one just composed of somnambulance and slavery."
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","mind_body","I would prefer the ability to live to age 90. The reason why is because I feel that life extension technologies should be in place by then to allow me to live even longer. Additionally, there may also be technologies that allow the mind and the body to function at or beyond the level of the average 30 year old. "
"R_2uWdSjeqpWpmh8q","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do was when my nephew was 2 and he used to come in and talk to us until he fell asleep. He was so imaginative, almost like he was dreaming with his eyes wide open. He would eventually just lay down, mumble and fall asleep."

"R_2vi7AGuXsmpZBb4","fire_rescue","I would run in and grab my filing cabinet. It has all my important documents in it that I would not want to lose. That would be the single most important thing to me after my family. I wouldn't want to replace the things in it. "
"R_2vi7AGuXsmpZBb4","friend_value","I value respect in a friendship. I think respect is the foundation of two people getting along. Without respect generally the friendship won't last very long. Respect is a key thing in friendships. "

"R_2VptESFUA7fOibE","how_raised","If I could change the way I was raised the first thing I would make sure of is that I never was born to the parents I had. My mother was pure evil and my father was afraid of her. Life would have been much different with parents who were able to actually love."

They were hers, and she was like a mother to me; raised me on and off during the times my parents were on the outs. They're these little lighthouses, which were he favorite structure, and just some old bulbs. Yet those are so very valuable to me, I would definitely go back in for those."
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","why_studies","For me it's all about time management; being able to do them when it's best for me, personally. I don't have to go through the fuss of getting ready, driving there, dealing with other people if I don't have to, I can just focus on the study in the comfort of my own home without losing commute time. I'm also an introvert, so it's mentally and physically exhausting to be in that setting physically."
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","mind_body","I would personally rather have the mind of a 30-year-old. If you think about it, what's the good in looking young and being able to move around like a 30-year-old if your mind is, forgive me, mush? I'd definitely prefer to be able to still articulate things well and continue to be able to do my design work on the computer. However, maybe I would have arthritis and that would inhibit that; that's a tough question."

Could you imagine the criticism those people get for just making personal choices? I suppose if I were to one day be known for my art, that would be kind of neat, but I can't imagine liking too much of a following."
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","how_raised","I wish that when I was little I would have tried to have more fun, be less concerned about my parents' situation. I was definitely consumed on wondering if it was my fault that they fought so much, so I was kind of a sad kid. But I would say I was ""raised"" well enough, maybe if we hadn't moved so much I would have also been happier."
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","garden","I'm not much of a gardener, in fact, I'm the type to buy fake flowers and trees so I don't have to accidentally kill them in the process. I do, however, have a few rose bushes in my garden that the prior owners left behind. They're beautiful and easy to tend to on my own. I would love to have an apple tree, but that's a process that worries me a little bit about my current track record and growing things. "
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","friend_value","Honesty, trust and of course those awesomely long drawn conversations about nothing of importance. To be able to that just speaks volumes about how you and the other person are just made to be friend ""material"". I love it when we can just pick a topic at random, carry through it and then switch back to something more relevant. "
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","religious","I am personally not a religious person, though I was raised Catholic, it just didn't give me a sense of comfort when I thought about religion. In fact, it resulted in an immense amount of anxiety, and I believe that's because I was so unsure of what was real, who was lying or exaggerating about stuff. I'm such a ""to see if to believe"" kind of person that it made me uneasy and kind of shut down. I definitely love that people do believe though, I'm glad they had something like that to comfort them."
"R_2vYzx6A9FxVCfQ8","strangest","I grew up in an old garage, that had been converted into a house, so everyone called me the ""garage dweller"", not a very nice name. But in relevance to the area I lived in, I'd say everyone here has an obsession with pepperoni rolls since they were originally created in my town. Then there's also a fad with pizza that has cold cheese put on top of it. I'm not a fan but people around the country actually order it their address frozen. "

When my oldest was about 7 months old, we would sing ""The Wheels on the Bus"" and her little arms would just spin like crazy and then she would fall over.

"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","mind_body","If i was able to live that long i would live freely i would be pleased to have. i would love to see it happen. I will cross my fingers that i get a long healthy life and that i live to see a beautiful world created and left behind for my children."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","last_sing","I sing to myself and to the people around me on a daily basis. I am a walking juke box. I am always singing and dancing different songs that are ear worms or just stuck in my head. I love to sing to my children and to myself. This morning was the last time i have broken out in song."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","famous","I would not want to be famous at all, ever. I do not like to have that much attention shined on me. I also know what it takes to become famous. You have to degrade yourself and the others around you to make it to the top. I am not willing to stoop that low for fame or money. I just want happiness and truth."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","how_raised","If I could change anything about how I was raised, it would be getting my step father out of the picture. He was traumatizing to my existence. He was cruel and abusive. He hurt my siblings and myself often."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","friend_value","I value friends who are real and accepting. I enjoy friends you do not have to censor yourself around. Who do not judge your for your train of thought but simply enjoy your company and life. I enjoy honest people who are real."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","why_studies","I do these online studies to help make some money. Sometimes they are kind of fun and other times they are little excessive. Every little penny that i make adds up and it helps. It all helps and i get to be home with my baby while i do it."
"R_2w06t5ARpezgEnr","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have ever seen a baby do is simply exist. Babies are the cutest things in this world. Watching them grow is a blessing. Seeing them smile and discover themselves and how to use thier bodies and what not is so adorable and innocent in every way."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","last_sing","I have been singing with my daughter lately. We are currently working on her singing her ABC's by herself. I love when we get to the end and she has the biggest smile on her face and gives me a huge hug and says ""I did it!"""
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","why_studies","The biggest reason for doing these online studies is so that I can stay home with my daughter but still be able to contribute financially to my family. My husband and I always talked about not putting our kids in daycare and this is the best way I could find to help with finances while not having to put them in daycare. I also love learning new things every day."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","like_work","Right now I am a stay at home mom so I budget for the family, clean the house, make meals, taxi everyone where they need to go, and of course raise the kids. For the last six months or so I have also been working online on mTurk making a little bit of extra money to contribute some."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","strangest","I would have to say that the strangest thing for most people is just where I grew up. Most people think it is crazy when I tell them that I used to live in Alaska. It was definitely cold there but we didn't have a dog sled team or igloo like most people thought."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","famous","I don't think I would like being famous. People get too nosy and involved with famous people's lives. If I had to choose something that I would be famous for though it would have to be some kind of contribution to learning or working with kids in some way."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","cute_baby","When my son was little he used to swing his arm at us and say ""S'go"" or in English ""Let's go"" ! It was so cute he used to get his whole body into it. He was always so eager for us to catch up to him. When my daughter was little she would poke her head around the corner in our kitchen and say boo. I am obviously biased towards my kids."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","mind_body","I would probably lean towards the mind of a thirty year old. I feel like if I had the body of a thirty year old it would be kind of pointless. I would still feel old and wouldn't want to impress a thirty year old anyway."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","religious","I am not necessarily a religious person because of the way I grew up. I consider myself more of a spiritual person. I think when you look at most religions there is a lot of things written by man that I just don't trust are completely from God."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","how_raised","I would love it if my parents had stayed together and were actually in love with each other. I think this would have impacted a lot about my childhood. I love my foster parents and everything they did for me but it would have been better had it been my parents showing me those important things in my life. I also think it would have been better growing up if my father hadn't used religion as a weapon more or less."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","friend_value","I think the thing I value most in a friendship would have to be honesty. My husband is my best friend and that is something we have talked about being important to both of us from day one. I also think it is important to have a friend that is there for you no matter what."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","garden","When we moved into the house we currently live in a couple of years ago my mother in law had given my son some tomato and zucchini seeds. He did awesome growing those but since then we haven't had that much luck. We tried last year but the place we planted the garden was too compact and nothing really grew."
"R_2w5ePatLneRA6HK","fire_rescue","I would have to go in and get my external hard drive. This is where my family stores all of our extra pictures. There are pictures of our wedding all the way through both kids and holidays and every other occasion."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","garden","I do have a garden, but no fruit trees. I have 3 large dogs, so we keep most of our back yard clear so that they won't eat any plants they're not supposed to. We do have flowers and grass in the front yard where the dogs can't get to."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","friend_value","Being able to share the good and bad times. I like being able to bring up memories and talk about the past. I also just like the time we can spend together, without a particular plan or something to do."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","last_sing","I don't think I've ever sang to myself to be honest. Maybe if you call a silly karaoke performance singing, then I can recall 1 time. It was probably about 20 years ago when my company went on a retreat and all employees were somewhat forced to participate in karaoke."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","mind_body","That's a very difficult question. I've experienced relatives reaching old age with both problems. It's horrible to get old and have your mind not be clear anymore. But it's also terrible to have a great mind but your body giving out. I would probably still pick the body though and hope that my mind stays fresh."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","why_studies","I do them to make some extra money on the side. Some of them are interesting, but others are repetitive. This one was quite interesting though. Totally different from just selecting bubbles from a list. Most people don't like writing much, but this topic wasn't that challenging so I didn't mind."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","fire_rescue","My computer. It has lots of memories on it, and it's pretty much critical to all I do. Everything else can be replaced easily. Not having my computer would be a bit of a hassle though."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","how_raised","I wish I would have had a brother or sister who was closer to my age so we could grow up together. I had a brother, but almost 8 years younger than me so there really was very little of a relationship. I miss that mind of close bond one can have with a sibling who's close to your own age."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","like_work","I do whatever I need to do to keep my boss happy. Luckily he gives me a lot of leeway so I'm pretty much self directed and self reliant. I always make sure I get the job done and as a result I get left alone. That's the best part about it."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","famous","I don't think I want to be famous. Being famous comes with its own set of pitfalls and disadvantages, so I think I'll pass. Being anonymous and blending into the crowd is not a bad way to live."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","religious","I am not religious at all. I believe in the concept of God, but I strongly disagree with the physical form that most people believe in. I also feel that people mostly focus on the rules and regulations of religion and use that as a guide to criticize others instead of focusing on the positive parts of religion. I just figure I try to be the best person I can, no religion needed for that."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","strangest","I don't think there was much strange about it. It was a small town for current American standards, so I grew up with quite a bit of greenery and no risk of getting kidnapped by a child molester. I guess the strange thing would be how carefree it was."
"R_2WOJEogrEBqI8nq","cute_baby","I love the way babies can smile. It's something that just melts your heart. I have no idea whether they actually know what they're doing or not, but it's just the cutest thing in the world."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","strangest","I grew up in a pretty homogenous area. The vast majority of people in the town I grew up in were white, Christian and upper-middle class. I think not having much diversity in my town was kind of strange."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","like_work","Right now I'm in my last year of college. I'm studying economics as my major. I'm not really sure what I want to do for work after I graduate. "
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","friend_value","One of the most important qualities in a friendship for me is loyalty. I would drop anything to help my friends and family, so I value the same from them. It's nice to know that there will always be people who have your back."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","why_studies","I do online studies mostly to make money. It makes me feel like I'm using my spare time productively. Some of the tasks are fun, but I probably wouldn't do them without compensation. "
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. Growing older physically doesn't scare me, but growing older mentally does. My Grandma actually has Alzheimer's, so I've seen first hand how awful mental decline can be and how your mind really makes you who you are."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","how_raised","I would probably want my parents to be a little less protective. I know it came from a place of love, but they could definitely be a little over-protective at times. I think that would have given me more freedom and confidence when I was growing up."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","last_sing","I mostly sing to myself when I'm driving. I like turn up the music loud enough so I don't hear my own voice, haha. I don't like singing in front of other people because I don't have a good voice, but when I was at church last weekend I sang along with the hymns."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","garden","No, I don't have any. I've never really tried to grow anything outside before. I think it would be hard with the weather here. Sometimes we get frosts as late as May, so I would be worried that my plants would die off before we made it to summer."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","cute_baby","I was handing out candy on Halloween and a little boy who was maybe 3 years old came to the door with his mom. He saw my cat sitting on the stairs and he ran inside and up the stairs and gave the cat a big hug. His mom apologized, but I just thought it was cute."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","fire_rescue","I would save my laptop first. Partly because it was expensive, but it also has all of my pictures and information saved on it. That would be something that I wouldn't be able to replace."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","famous","I definitely would not want to be famous. I would like the money and all the other perks that went along with it, but not the fame itself. I would hate having no privacy, so I don't think it would be worth it for me."
"R_2wReecaFCiFJZfA","religious","I am not a religious person. I was raised as a Christian, but I just kind of grew out of it and stopped going to church. I have nothing against religion, but I personally am not religious."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","famous","Thanks for asking me this. I always had a dream to be a rock n roll singer. It seems like the best thing in the world to me to create and sing your own creations. The world would love me. My fans would cheer and I would graciously wave to them at the end of a concert. Unfortunately God in all his wisdom did not give me talents in this direction."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","like_work","I have done a lot of things but right now I am in sales. I am part of a much larger company that is a house hold name. You would know it if I told you. I travel quite a bit but only locally. By that I mean a 3 state area. I like the travel. I like the people. I really like being on my own and going somewhere new every day."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","mind_body","That is an interesting question. For me it would have to be my mind. I mean who wants to be senile with a 30 year old body? It seems like a great waste to me. Now with a mind that is active and always questing. With 90 years of experience to draw on, a man can change the world."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","strangest","The strangest thing would be a local tourist attraction. It is really neon and plastic and nothing special to talk about. However, it has one of the best marketing plans I have ever seen. The place sits on the interstate highway and for hundreds of miles in each direction they have set up billboards. The billboards are really stupid too but are funny in a strange way. An interstate traveler sees these things and by the time he gets to the attraction, he has to stop."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","friend_value","I value trust. Friends should be able to complete trust each other. Just knowing that someone else will listen and understand what you say is an invaluable gift. Then knowing that that friend will not betray you to others, well what could be more important?  Yes trusting in a friend is the most valuable thing in the world."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","garden","I do not currently have a garden. I did grow up on a farm and worked constantly on it. We grew cotton, soybeans and cucumbers for cash crops. My mom had a house garden where she grew all the household vegetables. At the time, I hated working in that garden. Now looking back it was one of the best times of my life. I do not have a garden but I really want one now."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","fire_rescue","I would jump back into the house to save my moonshine jug. It is a piece of glass. I know this but I have owned it for 50 years. Before me it came from my grandmother. Before her it was her fathers. Risking my life for a jug that has been in my family for four generations is a reasonable thing. Don't you agree?"
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","why_studies","I think it is a productive use of my time. There is no real money involved but it does mount up over a couple of months. I can either be playing some computer game or surfing the web or being productive. I choose being productive. i spend time that I otherwise would have wasted and in return my grandchildren get cool gifts. It is a reasonable trade to me."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","cute_baby","That would have to be my daughter. She was 3 or so and had a cookie in each hand. The dog was constantly trying to take it away from her. She was continually waving her hands around to keep him away. I laughed and put the dog out. I then asked her to share with me. She looked at me, then the cookies. She took a big bite out of one and gave me the rest of it. I still laugh thinking about it."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","last_sing","I sang to myself yesterday. I was walking like I do every day and listening to an album called Golden Oldies. A group called the Box tops came on and sang an old song called ""The Letter"". From the first note I was waiting for the lyrics to start. I sang the whole song out loud and everyone around heard. I hope my fans enjoyed it as much as I did."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","religious","I am not religious in a conventional sense. I do not understand how any one religion can be the right religion. I mean, how can there be only one way to God? All religions are man made. No matter how old, somewhere in its' past there is a man or  woman that decided that this is the path to God. I  believe in what I can see and what I can understand. There is a God. However he is not man made."
"R_2wRzNwBAj50S3ac","how_raised","Everyone has things in there past that wish they could change. For me it would have to be drinking. My dad drank a lot. He was not a happy drunk either, rather a mean one. When he drank my brothers and I had to hide in the fields around the farm. It was a scary time for a child. Yes. I would ban all drinking anywhere if I had the power."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","like_work","I work for the United States Air Force. I process the new students right out of basic training. I enjoy it because I have a sense of accomplishment assisting these brand new members of the military. It's always interesting interacting with them and seeing how the Air Force has changed."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","famous","I don't want to be famous. I don't have any desires to be famous because the amount of exposure that comes with it. The only way I would want to be famous is low-key or famous only in certain social circles."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","strangest","I think the strangest thing about were I grew up is that its basically three different cities on one block. My moms apartment was located in Pacheco but technically, right up the street was Martinez. If you continued towards the other way it was Concord. Our mail would sometimes get messed up because Pacheco wasn't always recognized."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","mind_body","I would like to retain the body of a 30 year old. Although my mind might not be as great I would be able to enjoy the company of my family. I think being able to interact with the next generation is really important."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","garden","I do not have any fruit trees plants or a garden. My current living situation does not permit me to have one. Being in an apartment, it is not currently a priority of mine now or in the near future."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","religious","I am not a religious person. However, I do attend church because, my girlfriend and her family are very religious. I was raised Catholic but my time practicing Buddhism and doing my own research led me to become Agnostic."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","fire_rescue","My last item would be my phone/wallet. These would be important to me because they contain on my personal information and everything I would need in order to make the contact I need. I wouldn't have to worry about trying to get new cards or contacting the insurance if I had these items. The rest of the things are material and can be easily replaced. "
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","how_raised","If I could change the way I was raised it would for sure be the encouragement I got from my mother. I was often scolded and always felt what I accomplished was never enough. This led me to be extremely critical about my actions and I always felt discouraged trying something that could fail."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do is imitate their parent. My baby niece copies the facial expressions that I make at it is adorable. She will also try to imitate the sound we make."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","why_studies","At first I did the online studies as a means of a secondary income that required little effort. Now I enjoy doing them because they ask some really introspective questions and I might not have asked myself. This gives me a deeper understanding and I feel like it's a way to find out more about myself."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was this morning. I was listening to Babyface's ""Every time I closes my eyes"" The last time I sang to someone else was my girlfriend. I sang 112's ""Cupid"" It is one of our favorite songs to sing when we are together."
"R_2wyu3BX4zyYVCwA","friend_value","The most valuable thing to me is being reliable. Being in the military I have a lot of close friends that I don't see that often. We share a close bond and I know that if there is anything I need they would be willing to do whatever is in their power to assist me. They know I would do the same."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","cute_baby","Too many for me to count. I ran a summer camp for many years so I was around kids all the time. There were hundreds of cute things per day, I couldn't name just one."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","famous","I would absolutely like to be famous. I always thought as a politician but politics is such a mess right now that I will be staying away from that field. So maybe as an entertainer or celebrity in some other fashion. There are lots of possible outlets."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","why_studies","Just to make some extra money during my downtime. Any money I make on here is outside of my regular income that already handles all of my living expenses. So I can use money on here to go out or buy fun things for myself."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","religious","No, I am not. I just don't believe in it. I have a lot of respect for people of all faiths. But I just tend to believe in science and beliefs backed by tangible evidence."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","mind_body","I would definitely go with the body. The mind is always evolving and in many ways is stronger past 30. But you can only fight nature so long when it comes to the body. Really that is an easy choice."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","like_work","I am an attorney. I do like some aspects of it, mainly being able to represent clients and argue in court. What I don't like is all the paperwork and rules that you have to follow. But it is a good career overall."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","how_raised","I was definitely too coddled and protected. This resulted in me not being ready to face what came at me in high school and especially college. As a result I have always been ""behind"" and when I was in my mid 20's acting like I had just gotten into college."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the car the other day. Can't remember what I was singing but I always sing along to the radio. As for singing to someone else that would be about 2 weeks ago when I was at karaoke. I love karaoke."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","fire_rescue","I would probably grab my computer. It is a high-end gaming computer that was really expensive. I would not want to have to pay to replace that."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","strangest","I wouldn't say anything too strange since I grew up in the suburbs of a major city. Probably just how quickly things could change would be the strangest. Like within a few blocks you could go from a rich upper-class area to a low-class ""white trash"" area to the straight up ghetto. So that was kind of strange."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","garden","No I don't. I live in an apartment. Also I don't have a green thumb in any way. This stuff is all just foreign to me."
"R_2XcUZvh97fNV71s","friend_value","Mostly the ability to have someone to do things with that shares my interests and hobbies. It is always better to have others join in with you when you go out and do things. So I just like having that deep bench of people to call on for that."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","how_raised","I would have liked more involvement by my parents. They were very young when they had me and I think they learned on me. When I was in junior high and high school, they didn't pay much attention to what I was doing when I was away from home."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","garden","I have one apple tree. I used to have more, but apples really leave a mess and the deer eat them if I don't get to them right away. They also attract bees when they are on the ground."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","strangest","I grew up in suburbia, but the area is completely different now. I think people would be amazed to know how much open space there was there when I was a child. It was considered a poorer suburb and now it is just the opposite."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","friend_value","Above all else, I have to be able to trust my friends. If I ever find that I can not trust someone, I will cut them right out of my life. I have no use for people who can not be trusted, especially friends."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","religious","I am not religious and never have been. I admire people who have faith and feel that they are lucky for believing. It makes things easier to accept, but I have never been able to simply believe, without some proof."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","mind_body","I would definitely want the mind of a 30 year old. The attractiveness or whatever, of a body don't really mean anything in the vast scheme of things. People who value a body over a mind are not relevant to me anyway."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","like_work","I am a restaurant manager. There is not much I like about it, but I have been doing it for a long time. I am pretty well-paid for it and actually pretty good at it."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","last_sing","I often sing to myself when I am alone and bored. I never sing where someone else could hear me. My voice is terrible - that is why I only sing to myself!"
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","fire_rescue","I would grab my photo albums. My old photographs are not copied anywhere and they and the memories they represent, are irreplaceable. I think I can buy new of anything else I would lose."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","cute_baby","My youngest used to talk to me like he was an adult when he wasn't even two years old. He went from yelling 'bus!' as his first word to immediately using sentences. I was asked once if he was using sentences yet and I said no. He looked at me and said 'I'm hungry', like he was listening and wanted to prove a point."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","famous","I have absolutely no interest in being famous. It seems to be such a shallow existence. I also do not want people watching and judging my every move."
"R_2xJDP1FAjrUy7lA","why_studies","I like to make use of my downtime. It is great to actually have something to show for my off time at the end of the day. It is nice to be able to pick and choose the work I do. I do not have that option at my real job."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind for sure! I want to be able to remember the good things that have happened in my life. I wouldn't want to have a 30 year old body if I couldn't remember the good things that I have learned over the years. I would probably become very depressed if I couldn't do that."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","garden","I used to try and grow things but I'm not very good at it. I don't try any more because it seems like everything I touch turns brown. I would love to have a garden but because of my physical health I cannot."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was in the shower this morning. I do that a lot. The last time I sang to someone else was when I saw my grandson last week. He is 2 years old and loves when gamma sings to him! I can sing off key and it doesn't matter. Her just loves for me to sing him to sleep."

"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","religious","I am not particularly religious but I am spiritual. I do believe there is something out there that is bigger than me. I don't think it is something or someone that is described in the bible or other religious books. I believe it is different for everyone. "
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","fire_rescue","If my house caught fire and I had time to safely go inside after saving my family and my cat, I would get my computer. It has all of my pictures and information about all of my financial accounts. I'm sure I would need my accounts information after the fire. I would also try to grab all of my medications."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","famous","I really wouldn't like to be famous. I try to be humble and honest in all that I do. In my opinion people that are famous become egotistical and less caring. I would never want to be like that. I believe all people are equal and they should be treated that way. Most famous people have the mindset that they are ""better"" than others and I cannot understand that and I certainly don't like it!"
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","how_raised","If I could change anything at all about the way I was raised I would change my mother's and father's relationship with each other. They fought constantly before he left us when I was 13. Now all of my 5 siblings and myself have relationship problems and I think that if we had had better role models we would all be happier today."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","friend_value","The thing that I value most in a friendship is loyalty. I want to be able to be myself with the person without being judged. I want to know in my heart that that person will back me up no matter what. I want to be able to know that my friend will be my friend until the end."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","strangest","I don't know if there was anything strange where I grew up but the area was way out in the country. There were 6 kids being raised by my mom so it seemed like it was safer than being in town. We all have great memories of being barefoot and running through the cornfield next to our house. We were poor but we had fun."
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is dance like nobody is watching! My daughter records my 9 month old granddaughter dancing all the time. Her family lives 800 miles away so I don't get to see them as often as I would like so my daughter sends me videos of the baby all the time. When she dances she is so funny and cute! It just makes my heart swell!"
"R_2XjQM9DqMojSIKZ","why_studies","I do these online surveys for money mostly but I really enjoy some of them. I have a BS in psychology and any survey pertaining to that interests me greatly. I learn so much! The money can be pretty good too if you work at it."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","famous","I would like to write books that become widely read, but I don't exactly want to be famous. I don't want to be someone that would be recognized on the street and followed by the paparazzi. I would use a pen name and ask my agent to keep me anonymous so that this didn't happen."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","like_work","I am disabled and don't have a job, but my partner and I write novels together, and sometimes separately. I enjoy writing novels with them because we bounce off each other in ways that can be very funny and amusing. When we're writing together, we often laugh out loud."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","garden","I have a garden that I plant every spring, along with some perennials that bear fruit. In the front yard, I have strawberry plants, a blackberry bush, and a black raspberry bush. In the backyard, I have a currant bush and herbs, and I plant tomatoes, potatoes, peas, peppers, and other annuals every year."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","religious","I am not a religious person. I grew up Christian, but I left the faith when I was 22. I do not believe in God anymore."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up (which is where I live in now) is how corrupt the town is. A man named Larry who owns a bar, and who is likely also involved in the drug trade, has basically bought the town politicians and is exempt from investigation. He rents the very valuable building his bar is in for $1 a year."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","how_raised","I would choose to be raised by completely different parents. My parents were very abusive and I struggle every day to function. I would probably not be so disabled right now, with PTSD and several different autoimmune diseases, if I had not been traumatized at an early age."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","mind_body","I would rather retain the body of a 30-year-old, because I think the life experience that people gain as they age is very important. I would not want my mind to be stuck where it is now for the next 60 years. My body is not in a very good state, but I don't really see it getting better in the future."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","cute_baby","When I was waiting at the Social Security office with my partner, a girl who seemed to be about four dropped something. She exclaimed, ""Fuck,"" with very clear enunciation. She seemed very proud of herself."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","friend_value","I value friendships where the other person understands me and where I'm coming from. I also think it's very important that my friends are willing to share their personal life and thoughts with me. I like talking about psychology and the mind and applying it to my life and my friend's life, and I like having friends who are willing to do that with me. "
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","why_studies","I need to make money. I can't work a job, and I can do this without too much effort, which allows me and my partner to buy things we need for the house. I will probably stop doing it once I can get on disability."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","last_sing","I sing almost every day to myself. I don't think I've sung yet today, but I know I was singing to myself most of yesterday. I also sang to my partner yesterday to let them know what song was playing in the store."
"R_2xY8sdJEFMICotW","fire_rescue","I would grab my partner's external hard drive, because it contains a lot of their work."

"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","last_sing","I actually just sang to myself a few minutes ago in the shower. I did sing to myself because nobody else was around. But, I did sing to my girlfriend the other night."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","friend_value","I value many things in friendship. There are many different types of friendships though. My most ideal friendship includes unconditional love, trust, and support."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","how_raised","I would change nothing about the way I was raised. I love my family very much. Though, I don't love every aspect of my hometown it was a great place to grow up."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","fire_rescue","If my house was burning and I had enough time to save one thing it would have to be my memory box. The things in that box are very sentimental to me. However, if I had a pet I would save them first."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","like_work","I currently work in the construction industry. I like the working with my hands aspect of it. However, there are also many things I do not like about it."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grow up is simply how boring it was there. It is so boring in my hometown you would even call it peculiar. Its just one of those things you have to experience for yourself."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","cute_baby","I have been around many different babies. They are all so cute. However, I do not recall the most specific cutest thing one of them has done."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","garden","Do I have any fruit trees? Why are you so curious to if I have any edible vegetation? Why yes, though, I do."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","mind_body","Gee, I don't know which would be better. I would probably say having a younger mind is better off in the long run. Except I just love to be physically capable."
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","why_studies","I do these online studies because as a student I am looking for a way to increase my income. I also find many of these surveys interesting and not a waste of my time. Why do you care?"
"R_2y1ayCC3M1UOFFH","religious","I am not a religious person. I choose to not be religious because I believe those barriers of different religions prevent us from truly living with one another in peace. I do consider myself deeply spiritual tho."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","garden","I only have a few plants. Gardening never really interested me. My outside plants have already died from the cold."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","friend_value","Looking back on all of my longest and most serious friendships, it's always been humor. The people I want to spend time with are always cracking jokes or laughing at my own jokes. When I want to hang out with friends, a large part of that feeling is wanting to relax and laugh."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","cute_baby","Probably the video where there are a bunch of babies sitting and laughing. The father acts silly and then they all start laughing at the same time. Everyone who watches the video starts laughing too. "
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","famous","I get a little anxious being the center of attention, so probably not. I always got anxious in school when having to make speeches and things like that. I wouldn't mind being a famous writer or something where I wouldn't get mobbed by fans. If I would be famous, I would want it in the most peaceful way possible."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","strangest","There was a doorway behind a mirror in the house I grew up in. The door was sealed and painted all white, and the a full length mirror was glued over it. I asked my mom one day what was in that door and she said she didn't know. She said it was there when we moved in, and was probably a small empty space."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","how_raised","I wish I was given more of a chance to succeed. A lot of times I was given a task or chore, then a parent would come in and show me what I did I wrong. Sometimes the criticism was of very small things. I would have been nice to just get acknowledged for finishing up the task. I think in the present I look over my own shoulder too much, maybe because of this."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","why_studies","It's a little extra money, not much, but some. It is a good way to pass the time while sitting in front of a computer. The studies are usually better than working for a business because at least you are contributing to some kind of body of knowledge in some small way. It also makes you think and stay alert to some degree. It seems overall to be  better than posting on reddit or playing a game or something like that."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","religious","No I'm not. I have both Protestant and Catholic in my family and I sort of resented being forced to attend services. I believed in it until my twenties, when I started resented the hypocrisy and contradictions of religions. I don't know if there is a god or not, but I hope if there is I wouldn't be punished for not being religious. Being punished and threatened is part of the reason I moved away from religion. "
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","mind_body","I would want the body for sure. Having less pain and physical problems would be more worth it for me. Also the ability to have sex is a big plus."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","like_work","I do a lot of different things, but officially I do sales. I have been working at the same place for a long time and have slowly took on a lot of different jobs. I do maintenance, cleaning, fixing computer problems, work with customers, and answer and make phone calls. I like the unpredictability of it. I like working with a few of the people there too."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","last_sing","Probably yesterday. I sing when I'm alone all the time. Usually I sing whatever I last heard on the radio or something that goes through my head. I only do it when I'm alone because I have a terrible voice. I'm only doing it for a short time, for entertainment, not to practice singing."
"R_2Y4miIX2Z4ptfrh","fire_rescue","This is easy, it would be my main laptop. I wouldn't even think of anything else. It  has a thousand different kinds of data that I wouldn't want to lose. My backups are only of the most important things. My backups don't have a lot of the fun or emotional things I'd want to save. I also wouldn't want to start all over getting a new laptop set up just the way I like it."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","why_studies","I do these studies in order to make a little extra money. I have a lot of free time at work during which I would be doing nothing anyway! So I may as well be productive and have a little more income every week."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that every nearby street had out of fashion, olde-timey sounding female names. Names like Erna, Bertha, Matilda, Enid, Esther, Ethel, Lillian, Hazel. I always found it kind of adorable."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","fire_rescue","I would go back to save the computer and hard drives. They contain all of our photos, movies, music and important paperwork. I wouldn't risk my life for these things, but if I was certain I would make it out, that is what I would go back for."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is kindness. If someone is kind, I can most likely overcome any other differences. I don't want to be friends with unkind people."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","like_work","I am an Administrative Assistant for an I.T. company. I do all the scheduling of the techs and customers. I perform accounting duties like preparing invoices and receiving payments. I also occasionally repair computers or software."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","cute_baby","Babies are gross, haha! I don't find things baby's do very cute. Though when I see young kids dressed as Star Wars or Disney characters, it's pretty cute."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","how_raised","I would change the way my parents treated food. I wasn't really taught how to limit myself. I could eat whatever I wanted, anytime. It would benefit me today to have learned self-control when it comes to food!"
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. I can take measures to make sure my body stays in the best shape possible for someone that age. But to assure that I would have a sharp, quick mind and not develop dementia or the like would be very nice."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","famous","I would only like to be famous if it was for a good reason. Like being an actor or athlete. And mostly because that would most likely provide quite a bit more money than I make now."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","garden","I do not have any fruit trees or a garden. I live in a very small apartment with no front or back yard. I do have a couple of houseplants. I do my best to keep them alive and happy!"
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","religious","I am not a religious person. Why? Because I don't believe in gods or the supernatural. Religion is nonsense and harms society."
"R_2YDIQYvMA5oi143","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the car this morning. I sang along to a New Order song. I last sang with my fiancee in the car last night. We sang Total Eclipse of the heart together!"
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","why_studies","I primarily do these online studies for the money. I'll grant that there's not a lot of money involved, but the flexibility of being able to work relatively anonymously and to reasonably concrete goals is nice. Also, some of them turn out to be interesting."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","mind_body","I'd rather have a 30-year-old body than a 30-year-old mind. I'm not even close to 90 yet but I already need to keep in mind that I'm not as young as I used to be. There are plenty of 90-year-olds who maintain sharp and curious minds through their whole lives, so hopefully I'd be able to do that."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","religious","No, I'm an atheist. It just seems to me that things can be accounted for through purely physical or material explanations, so there's no need to assume supernatural things exist, and not much evidence that they do. Maybe I would be if I saw something that would convince me, but as of right now I just don't believe that supernatural things exist, so why follow religions that say they do?"
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","how_raised","It would have been nicer if my Mom hadn't been so fond of the guilt-trip as a way to motivate the kinds of behaviors she wanted. But overall I can't think of much I would change, how can I know that it would actually be better? Lots of people had much worse situations than I did."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","famous","I personally wouldn't like to be famous, I get very self-conscious when I think people are paying attention to me. But I would like it if projects I worked on or things I accomplished were famous. I think that would make me feel like I had done something worthwhile and valued."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","like_work","Right now I don't have a conventional job. I'm trying various things, hoping to find something that's sustainable long-term, but I haven't found it yet. Mostly I'm looking for work that I find satisfying that doesn't stress me out too much. Ideally it would involve a lot of problem-solving, since that's what I enjoy doing."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","garden","I don't have anything like that, I live in a townhouse so I don't really have control of my yard. But even if I did I probably wouldn't, I find it hard to muster up the enthusiasm for taking care of plants, and I tend to have bad luck with it. But I sometimes helped my dad with the garden when I was a kid so I do have some positive associations with that sort of thing."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","fire_rescue","I'd probably save my computer. From a purely practical standpoint it's pretty valuable, being without it would be a big hassle, and I probably don't back things up as much as I should so I'd lose some stuff if it burned. That's a pretty non-sentimental answer, but I can't think of anything in my house that couldn't be replaced somehow."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","cute_baby","Nothing really springs to mind. I always have a hard time ranking things, especially when there's a highly subjective component. For some reason I just have a hard time thinking up examples for questions like this."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","friend_value","I value bonds of trust in a friendship. The sense of feeling like I can count on somebody to have my back when I need it is very gratifying. I also like having involved conversations about topics of mutual interest with my friends."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","strangest","I can't really think of anything especially strange about where I grew up. My experiences growing up sort of established what I think of as ""normal"", so to me it's the most normal place in the world. One weird thing was that our township had the same name as a town in a different part of the state, so some people would get them mixed up."
"R_2YgmdQheVhIlWyk","last_sing","I'll occasionally sing along with music when I'm by myself, so maybe a few days ago, if that counts? If singing ""Happy Birthday"" counts then the last time was probably at my sister-in-law's birthday. When ""Rock Band"" was still relatively new I would sometimes sing the vocals, but that was a while ago."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","like_work","I provide technical support for a large company for a somewhat old and outdated operating system that is still in use by customers who require specialized support. I like that it pays well and I work from home most of the time. It is also interesting because I often get to talk to people all over the world who are customers and need help with something."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","religious","No, I am not religious at all and consider myself agnostic. I was raised in a religious household and it was not a good experience. When I was about 17 or 18, the folly of religion started to become clear to me. Religion is most likely the creation of man and involves no god or supreme being. It was probably created for power and control over others. There is no way to prove that a god exists, so it is foolish to behave in a way that is meant to please a god or to demonstrate ""faith"" for something that may not even exist."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","mind_body","There is no question that I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. I have dementia in my family and have seen it in both my grandmother and now with my own mother and it is a terrible way to end up. It strips people of their identity and dignity and frankly, I would rather die than suffer from any significant degree of dementia."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","fire_rescue","I would try to get my computer because I have spent a lot of years accumulating information and photos that are stored on it. It also has important financial data that dates back a number if years, including electronic copies of tax forms that were filed. I also use it a lot for my work and it would be very time-consuming and costly for me to have to replace it with a new one and install all the programs and applications I normally use."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","friend_value","I place a lot of value on humility. To me, someone who is genuinely humble is admirable and I am drawn to people like that. It also find it extremely important to have common interests because without that, it becomes difficult and perhaps even pointless to spend time together."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","strangest","I think the neighbors in the neighborhood were the strangest thing where I grew up. For a time we had a neighbor across the street who was an old man who liked to read adult magazines and expose himself to young girls. Another neighbor just constantly tried to start trouble with everyone all the time and yet another neighbor was a busybody who fancier herself a witch. And yet another neighbor was an alcoholic who used to yell all the time at his family."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","why_studies","These online studies are sometimes interesting and it is possible to actually learn things from them on occasion. They can get a bit repetitive, particularly with psychology studies because it seems like most of the researchers are using standardized questions from the same psychology text books and these questions appear again and again. They usually do not take up too much time and they add a little bit of extra spending money to the budget and help use up ""down time"" during working hours, which happens quite a lot with my job."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","cute_baby","My wife's nephew has three young daughters, ages are approximately 3, 5 and 7 years old. One day we were visiting at my brother-in-law's home and his son and daughter-in-law were there with the three young girls I mentioned. They were all blowing bubbles outside and having fun. The middle girl (5 years old) dropped her bubble solution on the ground by accident and it all spilled out on the ground and she started to cry a little. The youngest girl approached her with a sad look on her face and offered her bottle of bubble solution to her older sister and did not complain when she actually took it."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","garden","No, I have had a vegetable garden in the past but in recent years I have not bothered with it. I have never had any fruit trees but I would like to have some at some point in the future. We do plan to move in a few years when both my wife and I retire and at that time I plan to get back into vegetable gardening and I would surely like to have some fruit trees as well."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","how_raised","I would have my mother be less protective of me. She was the type of mother that was always worried and although she didn't limit our freedom too much, I always had to worry that she was worried about me when I wandered off from home a bit while out playing with friends. It always made me feel a little guilty and obligated and I just wish she could have been a little less demonstrative about her worries and concerns for her children."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","famous","No, I do not think I would ever want to be famous. Famous people have to endure too much attention and scrutiny. Someone is always trying to snap photos of them or find out about their personal business so it can be published. I am more of a private person and would not care for it if people were always trying to gather information about me. I would like to be wealthy, but I have no desire to be famous."
"R_2YWd7NRkv6hQC8C","last_sing","To be honest, I hardly ever sing to myself and much less to anyone else and I cannot recall the last time I did either. It is very possible that I never sang to anyone ever since that would make me feel self conscious and I also do not think I have a very good singing voice. I do not pay attention to song lyrics as much as most other people do and I am not good at remembering them. I never fancied myself a singer at all."

I guess my answer to that would be when we lived in Fayettefille, NC, my father was a recruiter for the Navy and Fayetteville is a very ""Army"" town.  I felt like we were the oddballs in the community."
"R_2zRO82nd4WWTE83","how_raised","Well, my father was in the Navy for 30 years and we moved every two to three years. I was the middle child and very shy, so it was particularly hard on me.  Just as I was establishing good friendships it was time to move again.  It really affected me, and not in a good way."
"R_2zRO82nd4WWTE83","mind_body","Well, I've had this feeling since I was a child that I was going to live to be 100 - and maybe by then medical advances would be so that you would have both. But if I have to choose, I would choose my mind.  I would hate not having my memories or not being able to recognize and speak with the people I love."
"R_2zRO82nd4WWTE83","like_work","I manage the office of the CEO for ______ Hospital.  It's the best job I've ever had, and I hope to stay there forever.  I feel like I'm contributing to a greater cause no matter how much I do.  I've also been able to connect friends and family to some of the best doctors in the world. One of my aunts lived 10 extra years because of her doctor's care."
"R_2zRO82nd4WWTE83","religious","Yes, I would call myself religious and spiritual.  I always have been, but more so in the last few years.  When I am particularly down or upset I can literally feel my parents, who are both deceased, I can feel them, one on each side, enveloping me with their arms. None of my siblings feel this, so I feel extremely blessed to feel them here."
"R_2zRO82nd4WWTE83","friend_value","In a friendship I value honesty the most. And not just the ""won't tell lies"" honesty, but I want my friends to tell me when I look ridiculous in what I'm wearing, or I got my hair cut too short...things like that.  But, the won't tell lies honesty too,"
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","friend_value","I value the ability to have honest and open conversations like this one. To kind of 'spill' your mind about whatever you're thinking about whether that be politics or philosophy or just random little musings. To be able to discuss things without being judged or thought of harshly. It's a kind of sincerity you can't really get most of the time. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","cute_baby","Honestly, I don't really pay that much attention to kids. I do think it's cute when you can make them laugh just by looking at them though. The thing about little kids is once they start laughing they can't stop. I was doing that to my cousin one Christmas and he started hiding his face behind the back of the chair. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","why_studies","Well, I started doing them because it was a way for me to work from home. I've always liked talking about myself, I'm kinda self-absorbed like that I suppose. I can help with academic research, make my opinions know and make a little bit of extra cash too so It all works out. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","like_work","Doing work online through mTurk pretty much is what I do for work. Academic studies, transcriptions, some image editing and things of that nature. I like that I set the hours. Back when I was working my last job that was the thing I hated the most. Your boss sets your hours, work til 10 at night then have to come back at 6 in the morning. If your friends or family want to do anything you probably can't because you have to go to work. So, I like making my own hours and schedule. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","how_raised","I really wish my parents had been more involved with other people. It's strange because I'm kind of shy now, but that's because as a kid I pretty much never saw anyone else. I was home-schooled, spent most of my time at the house and never really got to meet anyone outside. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","garden","We, my family and I, live on a pretty big piece of land. We have some olive trees, a peach tree and recently we've been working on a little salsa garden. I'm a big fan of the salsa garden myself, the fresh peppers are awesome to cook with. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","famous","I used to think I wanted to be famous, though I've since decided that I wouldn't really want to be. I don't think I'd like all the attention and having every detail of m life scrutinized by people trying to pull me apart. If I had to be famous for something though I'd like it to be for some thing creative, like writing a book or a song that really spoke to people. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","strangest","There was a lot strange about where I grew up. My grandparents, whom I lived with, had been on the property for a long time and had built a new house shortly after I was born. You could still see remnants of where they used to live though, like, there's this lamppost out in the middle of nowhere in the woods. It used to be part of their front yard, and by the time I was old enough to think the plants and trees had grown up around it. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","last_sing","I've never really sang to someone else, I'm far too self conscious for that and I'm not a very good singer. I sang to myself last night, though it was because I was practicing guitar and trying to sing along with my playing. I don't know if that really counts, but that was the last time. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","mind_body","I think that I'd rather have my mind. I've never had a particularly great body, even when I was a younger man but I've always had an at least passable mind. I enjoy thinking about things, ruminating, playing games and things like that. You could argue that if I lost my mind I wouldn't care anymore, but honestly 'losing my mind' is one of the scariest things I can imagine. "
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","religious","No, I'm not religious and I haven't been for the majority of my life. I grew up in a baptist household, but there was never a strong focus on religion growing up. We never went to church and my parents never read me the bible or anything. A lot of little things kind of lead me away from Christianity, like how could a caring God allow for so much suffering? I could honestly write a whole book of my reasons for not believing and my atheism has only grown stronger over the years."
"R_300jLmdIHQnbzJy","fire_rescue","That's a really hard question to answer, honestly. I think I'd have to try and save my bass guitar. I own a lot of things that are more expensive and probably a lot more useful than that, but it has sentimental value. My grandmother bought me that guitar for my 16th birthday and she isn't around anymore. "
"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","mind_body","I would want retain a mind of a 30 year old. Looks can only get a person so far. It is what's on the inside that counts."

"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","garden","I am not growing any gardens, fruit trees or plants at the moment. I don't have the time to do so right now. However, someday I would love to grow my own food."
"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","how_raised","I wish my parents would have raised me to be a little more outgoing. I am rather shy and I believe it has to do with how I was raised. I wish I could have done more sociable things."
"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was in the car a week ago. The last time I sang to someone else was the other day, I sang to my daughter. She loves it, even though I don't think I sound good."
"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","friend_value","The thing I value most in friendship would be honesty. It is very important to be true and honest to the ones you care about. I am honest and expect it in return."
"R_30bMSBAYkEw4J9X","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do is jave their first laugh. It is just simply adorable. I love when babies laugh."

"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","famous","I would like to be famous. I think it would be fun to have people like you that much. It would get me a lot of attention. At the end of the day though I would rather be famous for founding something that would help others in countries that are so poor. Like maybe a better way to get clean water systems or something like that!"
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","like_work","I am retired but do Mturk for some income to go along with my Social Security.

"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","garden","I tried to grow a small garden this summer but it didn't do very well.
My cucumbers got about 6 inches high and just stayed there never producing anything. My tomato plants gave me two tomatoes and one was eaten by birds. I don't know what happened as in the past I have had beautiful gardens!"
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","religious","I am a Christian. I believe everything the bible says because I believe it is the word of God! I believe I will be in Heaven when I die. I wish everybody would want to be born again!"
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","last_sing","Yesterday I did a hit on Mturk that had a short video of Rick Astley singing forever and ever and I was singing along. Last week my grandson was over and he was singing This is the day that the Lord has made and I was singing with him. I am a horrible singer but still sing anyway."
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","how_raised","I wish my parents would not have been so different than most. My dad was so strict and I seemed to never be able to do what others could. But in other ways they were great parents. I wish we hadn't been so poor."
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","friend_value","I love to have a friend that likes to sew or quilt because that is what I love to do. They also must be friendly all the time because I do not like to be around moody people. I want someone to do things with like going out to eat or shopping. It is important to me that they are a Christian."
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","fire_rescue","I have no pets so it would be my laptop because it has my work on it and tons of pictures. Also I keep a lot of stuff in files on it. Plus it is easy to pick up on the way out."
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","cute_baby","When my grandson was about 2 we went to a place called the fountains.It is a higher end mall with a lot of open air courtyard. They had a band out side that particular evening and a lot of kids and some adults were dancing. My grandson without anyone telling him to went out and found a little girl and started dancing. "
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","why_studies","I do these online studies because I need the money. I live on $680.00 per month and this supplements my income. Also I am handicapped so I can do these from home and not have to go anywhere to make some extra money!"
"R_30itcISiFonCaNZ","mind_body","The body. I have COPD now and at 68 my problems are getting worse. I am on oxygen part of the time and can't do what I used to do. So it would be great to be healthy again."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do was grab my face and lick it in attempt to give me kisses. This was my own baby, but it was still very cute. Babies do a lot of cute things because they are learning and discovering things. My daughter used to go up to people and give them hugs or say hi to them when we were out shopping. It really made someone's day and made them smile. She didn't care who you were, she liked you."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","mind_body","I think I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. I don't think it matters what my body looks like, that is just superficial. My mind though, I wouldn't want to forget important things. I would want to remember as much of my life as I can. I don't want to forget and not know where I am one day when I wake up."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","why_studies","I do these online studies to learn more about myself. The money is good too, but I mean I learned a lot about myself by answering questions and thinking about different questions. I didn't really know much about myself political wise until I started taking some of these tests and I got to know more about the different parties. I think now I have a better understanding about my thinking skills."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","religious","Yes I am a religious person because I believe in something greater than myself. I believe the things I learned in Sunday school and in church. There is no concrete reason for why I believe. I just know I do and that I am religious because I believe what the Bible tells me."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","how_raised","I would change the amount of money my family had growing up. While that seems kind of superficial, we didn't have a lot of money. I would also change the type of house we lived in. There were nine people living in one single story and at times we couldn't make ends meet. My grandma couldn't pay the mortgage and we often didn't have enough food to eat and wouldn't have anything for dinner. "
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","last_sing","I sing to my kids every day. We often sing songs to tv shows that come on the Disney channel, or we make up silly songs. This is an every day occurance. I sing to myself when I'm driving in my car. It is usually me doing errands on Saturday so that is when I get to listen to whatever I want and sing along with the songs on the radio. Sometimes I sing to myself in the kitchen, but usually my daughter chimes in too."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","like_work","For work, I work on Amazon and I also do some part time work with Appen. I like that I can set my own hours with it. I can do it throughout the day while watching my kids and spending time with them. I can stop and go out if I want too and come back to it later or not at all. I can pick my own days off, and my life isn't centered around a certain time block."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","famous","Sure, I would like to be famous in a sense that I wasn't getting photographed every second of the day. I would like to be famous for something I did but not to the point that it is going to interfere with my every day life. I think being famous would give me more self confidence that I can achieve things I didn't think I could."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the stories that were told about the Jersey devil. It has been said that the Jersey devil has chased some people and you can hear it at night in certain parts of the state. There are a lot of stories about different scary things in New Jersey. I think that is all that makes it strange, I didn't really encounter anything, though."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","garden","No, I don't have any of the sort at my house. I'm not good at remembering to take care of them. I would love to have fruit trees if I didn't have to water them or remember to water or take care of them. Of course, I would be worried about having more bugs on the trees and in my yard and I don't think I could handle that. I'm just not good at remembering to take care of those types of things."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","friend_value","In a friendship I value honesty. I think that is the most important thing when it comes to any kind of relationship.  That is pretty much your foundation to build upon. If you are not honest, then you have nothing to grow onto. You want someone that is going to be true to you and just tell you when things are wrong no matter the outcome."
"R_30r7nlOmQwJFi9U","fire_rescue","I would save my laptop if there was a fire. The only reason I say that is because it has my children's baby pictures and pictures growing up. I wouldn't be able to live without those. Everything is so digital these days that I would need that laptop. I haven't gotten around to getting physical prints of them, there would be way too many. I need them and us to remember what it was like then."
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","famous","I am not sure if I would want to be famous. Although my background is as a musician, I find that I want nothing to do with the business itself. I would like to be well known as a small business owner who sells quality crystals though. It would be great to be so popular that I don't have to worry about money and had the ability to do much good in this world. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","garden","I currently live in my parents' house, on the old family estate. There are trees and gardens everywhere. On the border of the property there are peach trees that produce lovely peaches in the summer. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","fire_rescue","Most likely my flute. Although I chose to major in voice instead, it is still very special. It was not a cheap instrument and is not something that one could replace. It is very special. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","why_studies","I do these online studies for a couple of reasons. Mostly because they are interesting and a very convenient way in which to supplement my income. I donate most of what I make on here to help out a friend. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","strangest","There is really nothing strange about the actual town in which I grew up. It is a typical small town. However, once an amazingly gifted musician from the city created an amazing musical legacy here...way out in the country. He brought in a bunch of musicians from the city to record a record with his high school choir. It was a recording of a Vivaldi mass, that is absolutely phenomenal and one would never guess where it was made. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","cute_baby","I am not really a baby person. However, I have really enjoyed watching small children disrupt religious services over the years. Children are sensitive and know that man made dogma seeks to control and is dishonest. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","religious","I would describe myself as spiritual, but not religious. Religion to me, translates to man-made Dogma, the herd mentality. People in churches remind me of sheep. I like to use the word ""sheeple"" to describe them. I would never want to follow the herd. Religion has very little to do with true spirituality---which is an inner communion with God. The Kingdom of God is within you, NOT in a church. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","friend_value","I value a number of things in friendship---common interests, a sense of camaraderie, etc. But probably the most valuable quality of all is loyalty. It is crucial that a friend (at least a true friend) stands by you no matter what. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","like_work","I am self-employed. I have a business selling decorative crystals on my website and on Etsy. I absolutely love being around so many beautiful specimens made by mother earth and enjoy the process of sending them off to their new homes. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","how_raised","I wish I had parents that were more spiritual and compassionate. They are very judgmental individuals who judge people by their outer accomplishments. I am sad that I was exposed to that. Most of all, I wish they would have taught me to be more independent, rather than be so controlling. I'm 35 and they still treat me as if I were 15. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","mind_body","I think I would prefer the body of a 30-year-old. Without the health of the body, it is different to exist and enjoy living to a ripe old age. I would not want the mind of a 30-year-old forever as I keep growing and evolving. I would enjoy having the wisdom that comes with age. So it would be wonderful to have the best of both worlds -- a youthful body, but a wise mind. "
"R_31HiGKi8ahU5on8","last_sing","I am a professional singer (with two degrees in classical voice), so I sing a lot. One of the few ways to make money (although I had organized religion) is to sing in churches. So the last time I sang was at two church gigs last Sunday."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","mind_body","I would definitely want the youthful mind. Intelligence is a very important trait to me and far more useful than being attractive but dumb. A smart person can continue to make money and enjoy retirement."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","religious","I grew up Catholic but sometime during my late teens I began to question religion in general. I am a very logical thinking person and I was finding too many things that didn't add up to me. I currently have a hard time believing in a higher power without any kind of concrete proof."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","how_raised","The main thing I would change about the way I was raised is I would give myself more freedom. My parents were very protective of my sister and I and it definitely prevented us from having the same experiences our peers did. We weren't even allowed to ride our bikes on the street until I was about 13 years old."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","fire_rescue","It would definitely be to grab my computer. I rely on it for so many things. It provides me with income, productivity and entertainment. It would also be one of the most expensive things for me to replace."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a child do was when I gave my little niece some candy after this last Halloween. Her eyes immediately got wide and she started picking out what she did and didn't like. My sister didn't want her to pig out on it so she took most of it away to eat later."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","friend_value","Loyalty is what I value most in a friendship. If a person is your friend they should be there for you through thick and thin. A friend without loyalty will abandon you rather than stand by your side."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","garden","I wish I had some fruit trees but there are only a few species that will survive the winters here. I used to do a garden every summer but it became too much work and upkeep for just one person. I grow a few herbs and vegetables outside during the season and bring a few of them inside once first frost arrives."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself would of been in the shower last night. That is about the only place I sing verbally to myself but I sing in my head much more often. I don't think I have ever sung to someone else because I cannot remember ever doing so."

I can still remember when I was very young we would spend a lot of time over there. I loved the farm cats but didn't enjoying seeing the long lines of caged mink. I think they made good money from their business though."
"R_31pmlrTXpZGDmFm","famous","Sometimes I feel like I would enjoy being famous because of all the appeal it has on the surface.

"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","cute_baby","I like a baby that smiles and coos. When they smile, I smile, too. Crying babies make me want to go somewhere else, so a happy baby is perfect. "
"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","famous","No, I would not like to be famous. I like being anonymous. It's my middle name. I don't even understand people who want vanity license plates on their cars."
"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","like_work","I'm an accountant. I trained to be a secretary, but the only job I could find was in accounting, so I took it. That was 40 years ago. I'm really like what I do. I like sitting in my corner in front of a computer and working on a problem. It's like a logic puzzle."
"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","why_studies","It's something to do and I make some money, too. I got into it initially because I could set my own work hours. That was important because I was my mother's caregiver. I had to be on call for her 24/7, so being able to come and go at a moment's notice was great. "
"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","friend_value","I value people who are open and honest with me, and who show me the same level of respect as I would show them. Friendship is a two way street. There's give and take. I really like a lively relationship with friends, but have quieter friendships with others that I value just as much."
"R_3ecKDM2RLFmtxG9","how_raised","I would not change anything about how I was raised. My mom and dad were there for us and made us feel wanted and that we belonged. We had good times and not-so-good times, but overall, it was normal and just what I needed. I think my dad worked too hard and too long sometimes, but that was him. I wouldn't have changed him. "

"R_3EFGmxxQ5RjJzZW","how_raised","That it wasn't so religious. I really would like to just be brought up without having to worry about religious things. It made life a little harder on me."

"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","strangest","Well, I grew up in Dallas, Texas. Easily the strangest thing about Texas, and much of the South in general, is how completely socially backwards and behind the times it is. People in Texas think that they're very progressive, simply because they see social progression happening. They don't realize thought that they started much further behind the rest of the country. They think they are progressive on issues like LGBTQ+ equality, simply because they allow civil unions. Sure, that's better than not allowing anything at all, but still starkly behind much of the country in terms of actual progress and equal rights. Many people in Texas are oblivious to this though and think they're doing just fine. It's also a weird place because people in Texas think Texas should be its own country and is more special than all other states in America."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","garden","I don't have any fruit trees or a garden because I live in a big city where we can't really grow stuff like that easily. I do, however, have house plants. I have cacti, basil and other herbs, and some flowers. It's sometimes hard to water them on time and I forget when I've last watered, but I'm working on it. I do love having plants, I think it adds something nice to the home."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","mind_body","I have been asked this question before actually and my answer is still the same. I would want to retain the body of the 30 year old for sure, because I think, more or less, one does still retain a youthful mind, as long as you don't let yourself go and/or have some sort of debilitating mental health issue or disease. So, I would want the younger body to accompany my already kind of ""younger"" mind."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","last_sing","I'm sure that I was singing to myself and that it was in the shower. I tend not to sing publicly for any reason, so if I sing at all, it is privately in my home. I tend to listen to music in the shower and sing along in the morning as I gear up for the day. So, I believe the last time that happened was 2 days ago."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","fire_rescue","If that happened to me, I would probably run back for my dad's guitar. My dad passed away when I was a child and that is one thing of his that I still have and cherish. It was picked out by a famous musician that my dad went to rehab with, which, while slightly morbid, is still slightly cool, too. It is for sentimental value, as I don't really need the guitar, but that is why I would save it over other possessions. "
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","how_raised","If I could change anything about how I was raised, I would have my parents move us to Chicago or somewhere more progressive and diverse than Dallas, Texas. Because I wasn't regularly exposed to people of different socio-economic status, race, religion, or sexual orientation, I was largely unaware of issues affecting those communities. I think it's pretty essential to be aware of those things if you're trying to be an informed, compassionate citizen, and it's sort of impossible to do that if you don't have those experiences or opportunities. Plus, I was gay but had no idea because I didn't have a concept of what a gay person was outside of twinky men who were sexual deviants and also killed themselves - not great things to look up to as a young gay person. So, I just wish I had more diverse experiences and more diverse people around me as role models."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","cute_baby","Kids and babies do a lot of good things, so that is hard to pick! I think the cutest thing I remember was something that my little cousin Anna did when she was a toddler. She kept pressing the automatic door button on my aunt's car keys and making the van door open and close over and over again. My aunt finally realized what was going on and said, ""Anna! Stop it! That van is NOT a toy!"" and at age 2, she promptly replied, ""Maybe not, but it's a toyOTA!"""
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","famous","I would totally like to be famous! Who wouldn't!? I would love to be a famous comedian. It would be really cool to make people laugh for a living, and also to have a celebrity platform to do good with. I would like to be the kind of celebrity that Ellen Degeneres is because she uses her platform to promote things that she believes in and make a positive difference in the world."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","why_studies","That's a good question. They can be tedious and time consuming, but I do them to make extra money. I work for a nonprofit organization, make a modest salary, and have a ton of bills. I am looking for other work, but this helps supplement my income in the meantime. Plus, they're not boring usually and I actually learn quite a bit from the academic research surveys. They can be very fun, and they're an easy way to make a buck."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","friend_value","When it comes to friendship, I value reliability more than anything. I have a lot of friends who are decent people and nice to talk to and be around, but the thing that matters most to me is if they will be there in a pinch/when I need them. I tend to go out of my way to be available for my friends in their times of need, and I'd like to think that my best friends would do the same for me. I think it's important to be there for people you care about."
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","religious","I am most certainly not a religious person. I was raised Jewish and had a Bat Mitzvah but have since been mostly non practicing. I think that religion is generally harmful, or, at a minimum, does more harm than it does good. It's so frequently used as an excuse to oppress and harm people or an excuse to simply do nothing when other people are being harmed (i.e.- ""thoughts and prayers""). I feel uncomfortable around people who are very religious because that tends to go hand and hand with bigotry, and as a minority individual, I try to steer clear of bigots! "
"R_3ENj8Kqx76VKPgk","like_work","I work for an arts and media nonprofit organization. I am the marketing and fundraising manager, but we are a small staff of three people, so I end up doing more than what's in my basic job description. We run film festivals, teach film production classes, hold screenings weekly, and provide other services to filmmakers to help them make movies. I like that we produce the LGBT film festival in Chicago because I think it is meaningful and important."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","last_sing","The last time that I sung to myself was in my car on the way to work.  I did so because I was alone in the car and wanted to do something to pass the time.  I didn't necessarily belt the song out, but I did verbalize the words."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","how_raised","If I could change something about the way I was raised, I would change my work ethic.  I feel that I had to develop a strong work ethic during my time at University and wish that I had developed this earlier.  If I had done so, then I would have been more successful than I am today."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","fire_rescue","If my house was on fire and I had already saved my loved ones and pets, I would attempt to save my file of important documents located in my safe.  I would do so because these documents are ones that are hard to replace.  As well one often needs a copy of them to prove one's identity when trying to replace one another."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","mind_body","If I could live to the age of 90, and have the ability to retain the mind or body of a 30 year old for the last 60 years of my life I would choose to maintain my body.  I feel this way because I feel that the mind is still growing well beyond the age of 30.  As well I feel that the body at the age of 30 is at one of the better points that it can be in relative to older ages."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","friend_value","The thing that I value most in a friendship is that the friendship is reciprocated by all parties.  I would hate to be in a friendship where there is not a balance between the two sides.  Rather I enjoy ones that are an equal opportunity for all parties involved. "
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","famous","If presented with the option of being famous I would choose not to.  I feel this way because I would not want to be the center of attention to people that I do not know.  I would rather live my life with my loved ones in privacy and joy."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","garden","Unfortunately I do not have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden at my house.  This is because I live in an apartment located in the middle of a city that does not allow me to grow such things.  All that I have is a small balcony that does not get very good sunlight, prohibiting such objects."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","why_studies","I perform these online studies so that I can gain an extra bit of income.  The money that I make from these surveys is not a lot, but over time it adds up.  Typically I will put anything that I earn from the studies back into my mortgage to help me pay less in interest over the long term life of my home's loan."
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","religious","I am a religious person and so is my wife.  We find that grounding our lives within faith gives us a good reason to do what we do.  As well it sets us on a path and gives us guidance in our lives."

This event happened at my brother's house with his child while I was at his house after working hours.  I went there to grab a few things and his wife opened the door to reveal the scene mentioned before. "
"R_3eqcMwOQdJH6hKX","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was that there was a suicide with a gun on my high school's campus.

That sense of transparency really opens the door to honest conversations with the people I love most."

I switch on my Spotify playlist while my car is warming up in the morning, take a big drink of coffee and start screeching along to my country music playlists.

I wouldn't want to be followed by any paparazzi of any kind of tabloids, but I would like to be the kind of famous person that gets written about in the newspaper for acts of goodwill toward those in need or for giving money to others. I think that would lead t a life of others acting positively toward my family and myself instead of the usual type of overwhelming fame that turns against many people."
"R_3EWRFDzBKtrBRpi","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30 year old. What society considers attractive and normal in terms of appearance have changed constantly, but intelligence and wit are something to be really treasured. Someone who is mentally sharp at 90 is living a much better and richer life than a 30 year old with a 90 year old's mind. Medical technology and medicine have come a long way to preserving the comfort and bodily health of old people as well."

I like that I can help shape a company's culture through fitness events, nutrition education, and raising morale - all while saving companies money."

I greww up in a household where I was raised in the Methodist faith, and when it came time to make that decision for myself as a young adult, I considered my spiritual journey.

Teenagers drive around the luxury cars their parents buy for them, and society revolves around the country club culture they created. It has a very ""Stepford"" feel to it, and there's hardly ever a reason to leave, anything anyone could need is less than a few stop lights away."

I do not consider myself a religious person, but I do believe in a higher power of some sort."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","garden","No, I currently do not have any fruit trees or an actual garden. One day I would love to have a big garden that includes a few fruit trees. I do have a few regular plants in front of my home. I have a small jade, a chenille, and a handful of succulents."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","friend_value","Trust is the most valued thing to me in a friendship or any relationship for that matter. Without trust, what's the point? I have been burned before when it came to trusting a friend, and I learned my lesson. The moment trust is broken, is the time to walk away."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","fire_rescue","First of all, this is horrible to even imagine. I would rather not have to think about something like this happening, but I guess it is possible. The one item I would grab would be the box filled with pictures of our daughter. I would hate to leave those behind because they are priceless."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","like_work","Other than a number of hours on mechanical turk, I do not have an actual paid job. I guess I would be called a Homemaker to many people. I stay at home and care for my young daughter while my husband works during the day. I set aside time to provide my input to online studies and surveys such as this."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","strangest","There was nothing strange about where I grew up. I cannot think of anything I could remotely describe as strange, at least not for all of us living in the area at the time. Perhaps something could have came off as strange to someone from another area, but I cannot say for sure."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","why_studies","I enjoy helping researchers in their journeys to either prove or discover facts. I find many of these online studies to be very interesting and I sometimes learn a thing or two myself. I must admit that the monetary reward for participating plays a role in why I participate as well."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","how_raised","I have to admit, I feel as though I had a pretty great childhood. This may be due to the fact that I possibly got away with more than I should have due to my parents' lifestyle. If I could change one thing, I would probably prefer to have been disciplined a bit more than I was."
"R_3FJqnPYB8PkArKc","mind_body","That is definitely a tough decision. I would have to say I would prefer the mind of a 30-year-old instead of the young body. The mind is much more important than the package it comes in."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","last_sing","I sing everyday in the shower and in the car during my commute. I have never, and will never sing to anyone else. I don't hate anyone enough to subject them to that."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","religious","I am not a religious person. I was raised very Catholic and went to a parochial school from kindergarten through college. It didn't take me long to realize that religion just didn't fit my beliefs. I respect people who have faith, but it's not for me."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","strangest","This may sound strange, but the suburban town I grew up in was very small, very Catholic, and very white. It was the kind of place where everyone knew each other, and I was in the same class of kids all through school. I never realized how segregated we were until I went to college and met all kinds of people of different backgrounds."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","fire_rescue","I would go back in for my laptop. It may not have sentimental value, but if I lose everything, I'm going to need to make money. I will need my computer for mturk."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","cute_baby","My niece was obsessed with secrets when she was a one year old. She would lean her ear into you so you could whisper secrets to her. Then she would get on your lap and lean into your ear and whisper her baby secrets. "
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","mind_body","I would take the body of a 30 year old. I'm banking on my mind only getting better with age. Experience builds knowledge. I don't think my body with fare as well. "
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","why_studies","Primarily I do studies on mturk for income. I quit my full time job three years ago, and freelancing from home gives me the flexibility I was looking for. Secondarily, while many surveys are unoriginal and repetitive, some are genuinely interesting and fun to complete. "
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","garden","I have two plants in my apartment. One is growing out of it's pot, the other looks like it's knocking on death's door. I don't have a yard, and I tried an urban garden on my porch, but squirrels dug up everything I planted and I haven't tried again."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","how_raised","I had very controlling, paranoid parents. I resent that I was kept in a bubble, often accused of doing things I didn't do. I wish my parents had trusted my more, and allowed me to make choices and have experiences that I missed out on."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","famous","I have no desire to be famous. I am perfectly happy with my quiet life. I think being famous isn't everything it's cracked up to be. You have to maintain an image all the time, you are at the mercy of photographers all the time, and people are just waiting for you to make a mistake so they can exploit it."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","like_work","I work two part time jobs. I use mturk, and few other sites, and work from home doing those. I also work a traditional, part time job where I proctor exams."
"R_3fkNj4FdFjirzfe","friend_value","I value honesty above anything else. No one is perfect and I can overlook many things, as I am not perfect either. But I wouldn't keep a friend who lied to me, there is nowhere for a relationship like that to go. "
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","famous","I would like to be famous to some degree. I think it'd feel good to be a leader for others and be able to use my fame to help causes. I would hate to be constantly stopped and not be able to go into public much."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do was in a youtube video. It was a baby who bit his brother named Charlie. Their reaction was priceless."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","mind_body","I would rather have the mind of a 30 year old. To have a young body but have mental issues that come with older age would be pointless in my opinion. I think I could have more fun and enjoy life with a younger mindset."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","strangest","I remember it being extremely safe area. I never had to worry about any crime or issues happening, I could just be out by myself all the time. Nowadays in everywhere else I've lived, I wouldn't want to go anywhere by myself."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","last_sing","The last time I sung to myself was in a car on the way to the store. My favorite song came on and I quietly sung it. I don't remember the last time I sung to someone else."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","how_raised","I would change the diet I was raised with. Instead of being raised on a diet of processed garbage all day everyday, I wish I was raised on a healthy organic diet. I think it would have saved me a lot of health issues."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","garden","I do not have any fruit trees or a garden at my house. I do have a few plants. One being an aloe vera, and another being a small flower bush."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","friend_value","I value when someone is down to earth and you can talk about any subject with. They share a lot in common with you and you're constantly having fun together. They are there to help you through anything."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","fire_rescue","I would save my computer since it's pretty expensive. I also do a lot of work on the computer that is essential for my income. It's the only material object that I have that has value."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","religious","No I am not a religious person. I believe in God but I don't believe in any specific religion. I don't feel I fit in with any religion and that's why I don't."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","why_studies","They are often entertaining and keep me busy. They also help progress studies. I also enjoy making extra income."
"R_3FRnB1rC0ItcDBw","like_work","I work from home on the computer. I do both Mturk and internet marketing. I enjoy working when I want and not having a boss."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","strangest","I would not even know where to begin with this. I think the strangest thing was probably the obscene amount of effort that everyone put into otherwise meaningless things like expensive clothing and cars. There is nothing at all unusual about seeing someone living in an absolute shack in the ghetto, but walking out to their Mercedes with a Prada bag. The priorities of people are just totally bizarre."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was today while listening to Rent earlier this morning. I was just doing some work, and routinely getting distracted by wanting to listen to it. The last time I sang to someone else was probably the last time I was with my best friend, about a month ago, when I was just messing around with her while making a fool out of myself."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","mind_body","In truth, I would want neither. If pressed into a corner, I would reluctantly choose the body. I feel like choosing the mind would just be a long-term exercise in frustration knowing that I could not use my body. At least if I only retained my body, I would not know enough to know that my mind was gone."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","why_studies","This is an excruciatingly easy one. I do them because it is an unbelievably convenient way to make extra money that I can then stash in a savings account and forget about. It's nothing you will ever get rich doing exclusively, but it is absolutely astonishing how fast all these small amounts of money add up."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","garden","As a matter of fact, I do! I have a really beautiful orange tree in my backyard that I have had for about 12 years. In addition to that, I also have a wonderful succulent garden that I have spent an inordinate amount of time and energy cultivating from scratch. Incidentally, there is also a fig tree in my house to which I am so partial it feels like a family member."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","famous","I have mixed feelings on this one. I think if I had to make a choice I would say yes. I think it would be kind of cool to be recognized everywhere you go and pined after by everyone on earth. I would also be a huge fan of the free swag, and relative ease of access to anything I wanted to do."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","friend_value","The thing I value most is honesty. Without honesty, there can really be no relationship at all. Though I do believe that there are nearly equally critical characteristics, honesty is sort of like the foundation without which the others are totally irrelevant."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","fire_rescue","Wow, this one is tough. It's very difficult to think of just one thing, but if push came to shove, on my final dash, I would go back in to retrieve my mother's watch that she wore everyday. She passed away several years ago, and it is probably the most important memento I have of hers."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","religious","I am definitely not a religious person. Essentially, I think that every major religion on earth has done more harm than good since the beginning of time. Even today, they routinely foster more conflict than harmony, and I really just want nothing to do with the situation. "
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","how_raised","I definitely wish that I had been raised on the West Coast. I grew up in Miami, and never really felt like I fit in. Despite it being a huge metropolitan area, it's actually really conservative. And I would have liked to be raised in an area that still had access to the beach, along with that lifestyle, but in a liberal area. "
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've ever seen a child do is make a mad dash to run up to me and hug me after we had spent some time together. I was friends with their parents, and slowly developed a relationship with their kids. The thing about this particular kid, though, is that they weren't terribly emotive by nature. So to see them do that just melted my heart."
"R_3FRvgcSsMEwOiPJ","like_work","I work as a freelance designer. What I love about it is that I get to spend every single day doing things that I am passionate about doing, and, frankly, would probably be doing for free if it wasn't my job. Beyond the creative aspects, I also just generally love that I constantly get to work with new and interesting people who inspire me. "
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","why_studies","I do these online studies so I can pay my bills.  If I don't do them, I wouldn't make ends meet.  It is a great opportunity."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","religious","I am not a religious person.  I don't believe in religion.  No reason to do anything religious if you dont believe in it."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","last_sing","I sand to myself today.  I have a cold.  I sing to check and see how bad my voice has gotten."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","fire_rescue","I will grab my laptop.  My laptop makes me money.  I need to make money."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","garden","I don't do gardens.  Gardens take too much time.  I am too busy."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that there are a lot of strip clubs.  Strip clubs are fun to go to.  I always spend lots of money."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","how_raised","I would go to more parties.  I feel like I am socially awkward.  I didn't socialize enough as a kid."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","famous","I would love to be famous.  That means I'll be respected.  Women love a man who is respected."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","friend_value","I value someones company.  I just want them to be there with me and relax and have fun.  I want someone to just hang out with."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","like_work","I am a cashier.  I like that after I clock out I get to go home.  I like that the job is easy."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","mind_body","I would want to be able to do what makes me happy.  I don't care for anything that doesn't end up with me me being happy.  If I am 90 and unhappy, I would not want to live."
"R_3FVyAAQbtAv3vpW","cute_baby","The cutest thing a baby can do is smile.  When they smile, I know that everything is alright.  It puts me at ease."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","why_studies","I do these online studies for work. I am employed from home so I can take care of my children, and these studies help to provide my income. I choose the ones that pay fairly."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","mind_body","If I had the choice to retain either the main or body of a 30 year old during the last 60 years of my life, I would choose my mind. The ability to do certain things would be nothing without the cognitive capacity to regulate it. One of them scariest things to me would be to lose my mind, so that's definitely the one I would want."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that it was well-known for shoes. Even my dad worked in the shoe industry as a young man. However, there are practically no remnants of this important part of the city's culture. I find it strange that there are no relics of the past."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","famous","I would not like to be famous. I don't really enjoy being the center of attention, so people coming up to me on the street woudn't be fun. However, it wouldn't be so bad if I was known for contributing a major piece of knowledge to academia."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","friend_value","In a friendship, the most important thing is trust. I think that trust is the most important value because you will know what to expect. This creates consistency, and furthermore, stability."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","fire_rescue","The one item that I would run back in to save would be my laptop. My laptop is what I use to earn my income. That way, even if I have nothing, I know that I can still provide for my family in the immediate future."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","like_work","For work I stay-at-home. I take care of my two children and I also work on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Most of the work that I do requires typing and using my problem-solving skills."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","cute_baby","The cutest thing I have seen a baby do is eat. Babies are such messy eaters. Whether it's cake or spaghetti sauce, I just love the way they get food everywhere!"
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","garden","I do have plants. In my living room window, using natural sunlight, I grow houseplants. I have an ivy that is doing very well."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","religious","I am not a religious person. I was raised in a religious household, but was allowed to make choices about attending religious services once I reached a certain age. After attending college, and studying biology, I changed my mind. Since then I have been an atheist. This is because I prefer to utilize logic."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I would spend more time with family. It took me a long time to be able to develop functional, and close long-term relationships. Also, I have a hard time relying on others. I think if I had spent more time with my extended family, that might be a bit different today."
"R_3G7VZKm8GjaUldw","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was today. I was singing along with videos that I was watching. That last time I sang to someone else was today, I routinely sing to my children."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised, I'd wish that my mother was more affectionate. She never really told me that she loved me or gave me hugs. It would have been comforting if she had."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","why_studies","Because it's an easy way to make money. And I also like being a part of a study and sometimes I see things online or on TV from studies I've done. It makes me proud that i had something to do with it."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","strangest","I cannot think of anything particularly strange about where I grew up. If it was considered strange, it felt normal to me so I wouldn't have thought of it as strange. It's all about perspective."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","mind_body","I'd rather retain the mind of a 30 year old for the last 60 years of my life. A body is nothing if I can't think for myself. I'd rather be sharp minded."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","famous","No, I wouldn't want to be famous. In theory it sounds like a good idea to be household name but I don't think I like the idea of people being in my business. The thought of everyone watching my every little move would annoy me."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","friend_value","Honesty. If you're not honest, even about the littlest things then that will tear down a friendship. If you don't want to talk right now? Just say so. Don't feel like dealing with me at the current moment? Be honest and tell me and I will back off and give you your space."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","garden","No, I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden. I wish I did though. I've always wanted my own garden to grow my own food."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","last_sing","Last time I sung to myself was today. I am a random person and at any given time I will bust out singing whatever random song pops into my head at the time, but usually only when I'm at home in my comfort zone. The last time I sung to someone else was yesterday. I sung to my daughter."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","religious","I believe in God, and am a Christian but I wouldn't consider myself to be a big religious person. I think people take religion too far. Some of the beliefs are a bit far fetched and crazy."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do was when my daughter was about 4 months, she had a bouncer that she would flip herself out of. I thought it was the cutest things since she would literally slide herself out of it and be half on the floor and half in the bouncer. Cute and very hilarious."
"R_3Gk6PRFu4A3pnyy","fire_rescue","Either my phone or my laptop. Both are used for my job and if I lose either one I would be shit out of luck. I currently don't have the money to buy a new phone or a new laptop if they were lost."

"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","mind_body","I'd definitely go with the mind. Looking and feeling old doesn't scare me as much as losing my ability to think. I've had grandparents almost become vegetables due to dementia, and it's horrifying."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","strangest","Honestly, I grew up in a pretty 'regular' town. It was a suburb of Atlanta, and I'm struggling to think of anything that weird about it. The strangest thing you could say about it was that most people kind of kept to themselves."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","friend_value","I'm big on someone who will show interest in me and not just want to focus on themselves all the time. I want to feel valued and appreciated, and not feel like we are friends of convenience. Also, I value the ability of someone who can be up front with me and tell me what's on their mind."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","like_work","I work for our county's tag and title office; I process tag renewals submitted by mail or internet. I like it because it's simple work and it doesn't stress me out. I can leave work at work, and I rarely have to stay late. It's reliable and steady."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","garden","My wife will occasionally plant things outside, but I don't really mess with it. Even if I didn't have a wife I don't think I'd be that into it. We actually cut down some fruit trees when we moved into our house because we didn't want to keep up with them."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the shower; I do this all the time. The last time I sang to someone was in the car this morning when I was driving my kids to daycare. Most mornings I'll let the kids pick a song and we'll usually sing along with hit."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","fire_rescue","I'd probably save an external drive. Most of our family pictures are on there, and those are irreplaceable. Which reminds me, I should definitely look into some cloud-based backup for that stuff."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","how_raised","I wish my parents had been a little less protective. I felt like I always had to hide things from them, and that hurt our relationship. I think we would have been closer if my parents would have trusted us more and been less restrictive in certain ways."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","cute_baby","I love it when young kids will imitate adults. I was trying to teach my son that we don't touch hot things, so I'd reach out toward a hot thing in our kitchen, make a pained face and say 'oooooh, hot', and now he imitates me whenever something is hot. It's adorable!"
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","religious","I am religious, yes. I believe in the existence of God and that He loves us. The whole thing just makes sense to me, and is personally fulfilling. I don't have a problem reconciling my beliefs with science."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","why_studies","It's a nice way to make some extra money. It feels good to have money that I could just blow on whatever I want. My family doesn't depend on the income, so I could spend the money on something stupid and it wouldn't hurt our finances. It's just money to play with and spend on hobbies and that sort of thing."
"R_3hzrNbfmhzzv8AS","famous","I don't think I would. I wouldn't enjoy the scrutiny and pressure. Also, I think that if I was famous and my fame started waning, it would make me feel less valuable or something. If I had to be famous, I'd want to be famous for discovering something and not have a famous face, so I could still be relatively anonymous. "
"R_3Hzv8bSpL9F0zs1","famous","I'd love to be rich, but I don't think I'd like to be famous.  I'm far too introverted for that.  I actually wish that fewer people would know who I am now.  Famous people don't ever get to take a break and just be invisible."
"R_3Hzv8bSpL9F0zs1","religious","This is an interesting question.  I actually spent a lot of time examining my religious beliefs when I was in my early-twenties.  The conclusion I came to was that I don't really believe any of the tenets of Christianity.  In fact, most of it seems pretty silly.  I know that's not a popular belief in Midwestern America, but it's held true for me ever since."

I've found that I really enjoy taking the surveys, though, and check for new ones every day.  I've only been participating for a couple weeks, but I think I'll probably stick with it for a while."
"R_3Hzv8bSpL9F0zs1","strangest","I grew up in a small town of around 5,000 people.  Our claim to fame was that we were the ""Home of the Cow Chip Throw,"" and there was a cow chip (which is a colloquial term for cow manure) painted on our water tower.  Every fall, there would be a contest to see who could throw a cow chip the furthest.  I'm pretty sure this was featured on David Letterman's ""stupid human tricks"" years ago.  We were very proud."
"R_3Hzv8bSpL9F0zs1","how_raised","At some point, I believe you need to stop blaming your parents for your childhood and just move forward.  That said, I do wish we had lived in a bigger town.  Because we were so small, we went to school with the same kids for all 12 years, and it would have been nice to have been exposed to a wider variety of personalities.  "

I started here just doing basic computer support, but I've been promoted over the years, and I now work as an IT Manager.  It's so rewarded to be able to improve established processes through the use of technology.  I fully intend to continue working here until I retire."

But, I do have dementia in my family history, so being able to keep a young mind also has its appeal.  I guess I would take either and be happy for my long life!"

"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","mind_body","I would definitely keep the body.  I was very active growing up and it's scary to think how much my body has broken down since then.  I can't even imagine what It would be like when I am 90.  So yeah I would take body without a doubt.  This way I can have my physical nature a long with all the wisdom I have gathered a long the way.  Seems like a pretty good trade off to me.  "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up would have to be how every is placed.  You can go from a very metro like area to pure nature in a matter of minutes.  You can go from the beach on the coast where you feel like you are in paradise to the downtown area in a short time and feel like you are in two entirely different areas.  Then you can go another 10 minutes and be in total suburbia land with all the big box stores and highways.  It's pretty remarkable how it has all been layed out. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","religious","I don't know if I'm so much a religious person in the general sense of the term.  I was born in a catholic household with very religious grandparents who attended church every Sunday.  We always celebrated Christmas and Easter and I always looked forward to those days.  But as I got older I have kind of strayed from it a little bit,  we still have the family gathering on the holidays it just seems like the meaning is a little different for me now.  I have a hard time understanding religion now if they are just going to change the rules like what seems to be happening,  it all seems a bit too controlling for me.  I still have ethics and morals but I don't know if those are coming from my religious background or just common sense and decency. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","cute_baby","I love when kids try to dance.  They have their own way of dancing and they do it so awkwardly sometimes they don't realize it, it's cute and funny to see.  It cracks me up every time.  They are so innocent and care free and they just don't care what anyone thinks they are just being a kid.  I wish I could go back to being like that to be honest. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","famous","Fame sounds nice,  but it's actually quite a pain in the butt from what I gather.  I am a person who likes my privacy and freedom,  so I'm not sure I want to be shackled into the being famous and having demands on me all the time.  If I had to pick something,  I think I would love to be a famous musician who can just pick and choose where I play and what I play so I can retain a sense of independence.  I've always imagined what it must be like to be able to play in front of a crowd of thousands of adoring fans who pay to come see you perform or just playing for 10 people in a bar somewhere.  "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","friend_value","I value loyalty in my friendships.  I know that is hard for everyone to accept and everyone has their own issues but I like to put a lot of effort into a friendship.  If you are going to commit a lot of time and effort to having a friendship, it's nice to know the person isn't just going to flake out on you at some point and leave you back at square one trying to find new friends.  I've gone through this in the past and it's really tough.  Mentally it makes you feel like you've done something wrong and can send you into a spiral. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","why_studies","Because at the moment I'm not working.  It helps provide me with some income while I'm just sitting around anyway.  Instead of being completely unproductive, I am able to pay some bills and get money.  Some of them are really interesting too and I feel as if I can help contribute to making things better. i get to make money from home so it's really not that bad. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","garden","I have a garden kind of.  It's not a typical garden where you have a patch of land and you plant vegetables in rows.  I have many large planters in which I plant the vegetables and I can move them into the best spot to get sun.  I have all kinds of different tomatoes,  some peppers,  strawberries and cucumbers.  You'd be amazed that you can grow cucumbers in a planter,  you just need something behind it for the vines to grow on.  I enjoy doing it, it gives me a sense of responsibility and you get fresh vegetables out of it. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","how_raised","That's a hard question really,  I was raised fairly well.  My parents always did the best for us even in hard times and we had to move around a lot.  I was raised to be tough and resourceful and having so many different experiences growing up really got me ready for the real world.  If I had to absolutely had to pick one thing,  I would say I wish I was raised better in terms of eating healthier.  That's really the only thing I can think of. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","fire_rescue","I would save my box of things I saved from my grandfather after his passing.  It contains a lot of his medals from World War 2 as well as a few other trinkets he collected from the past.  I would absolutely hate to lose these items because they are irreplaceable.  They represent history and give me a sense of pride in my family and what they have gone through and where they came from.  There's other items I would like to save sure,  but these can never be replaced. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","like_work","Right now I'm not doing anything except taking surveys and doing tasks on Mturk for some income while I'm not employed.  It actually helps more than you think.  As for what I am trained in,  my last job really helped me use all of my talents.  I was able to work from home doing technical support,  web design and graphic design for marketing materials for my cousins company.  It felt as if everything I had trained in culminated into one single job and I was ready for it.  The company was sold off though and I got replaced by the people they wanted to hire so that was kind of unfortunate. "
"R_3IY7Xg9nungEWP4","last_sing","I sing to myself everyday!  I love singing along with my favorite music.  I listen to a lot of different music and I'll find myself getting lost in singing along to song after song after song.  It doesn't matter if it's metal,  country,  rock, you name it.  If I like the song and know the lyrics,  chances are I am going to be singing along with the song.  Pick a song,  let's see if I know it and I can sing it! "
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","how_raised","I would change the fact that at times it seemed like my parents didn't care as much as they should about certain topics. To some extent they were great parents, but in other cases I feel they were lacking. I try to overachieve with my parents especially my moms failures. I try to be a great mom. "

"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","fire_rescue","If I could save 1 thing it would probably be my phone. I know it is probably seen as kind of sad, but I am addicted to my phone. I use it everyday. Without my phone I feel incomplete. It is funny when I think about it, but I would definitely choose my phone, it is my lifeline. "
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","cute_baby","I don't know if this is the cutest thing of all time, but it is the first thing that comes to mind. My 2 year old Addalynn walking up to me and saying mom your my best friend, I love you. I had never heard her say it before and didn't know where she had gotten that. It was definitely super cute!"
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","friend_value","The thing I value most about friendship is being able to be yourself with another person, without that person judging you. My longest friend and I have known each other since elementary school. When we get together we can pick up right where we left off. "
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the location of our home in the woods. My parents had like 3 acres of land, and part of it was the huge hill with trees on it, and in the back there were these creepy woods. It was scary to go out there in the woods at night."
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","religious","I would say that I am religious person, but I often don't practice it. Do I believe in GOD, yes definitely, and I believe in the higher power. I just don't follow every rule in the bible or attend church every Sunday."
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","famous","I wouldn't like to be famous in the sense that you would have no privacy. You see famous people on TV and every aspect of their life is analyzed, and picked apart. I couldn't handle not being able to do anything without someone trying to get a picture, and video of me. I would not enjoy it at all."
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","like_work","I work for a window company in Northern Michigan, Wojan Window and Door. I work in the office, with a job title of customer service. The one thing I really like about my job is the family friendly atmosphere, flexibility, and ability to do my work the way I want to."
"R_3J4q3xrCkf3GYdo","mind_body","If I had to choose between the mind and a body of a 30 year old I would probably say mind. It scares me to think one day I could grow up and start forgetting things and people, especially my children. Just because the body ages, doesn't mean it can't do anything, but without your brain, it is hard to function through life."

They are also not accepting of LGBTQA+ individuals, and as a queer person myself I can't support a religion that thinks I shouldn't exist."
"R_3Jru8urtQhRhVMn","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind. A body can break down but I would rather have my memories, thoughts and self intact in a broken body than have a perfect body but the mind of a person that old. Bodies can still manage to do what they need to do, but what's the point if the mind is broken?"
"R_3Jru8urtQhRhVMn","fire_rescue","My playstation 4. I put so much time and money into that thing, I'd be devastated to lose it all. Other things are important, too, but I have an attachment to that thing."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","famous","No, I would not like to be famous. The only part about being famous I would enjoy, however, is having my name immortalized for doing something great. I would love to write a book, but not for the fame of it. Mostly to just say, ""I wrote a book!"". Fame brings way too many problems for me that I'm not interested in dealing with."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","how_raised","If I could change anything, I would have it so my parents better prepared me for life, in general. What are interest rates, how to go about taking out a loan, buying a cheap car, things like that. I feel like my parents didn't equip me for life much at all, really."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","garden","Yes, we have a small garden, trees, and plants in the yard. We also buy some flowers in the spring, plant them, and buy summer they're looking vibrant and beautiful. We love our trees as well, and make sure to take good care of them."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","cute_baby","I know this won't sound cute at all, but I was holding a baby boy last Christmas, and he was maybe a few weeks old at most. He was incredibly cute, and tiny. Anyways, he ended up pooping while I was holding him, and the face he made was the cutest thing ever."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","strangest","I don't think I recall anything strange about where I grew up. Besides living in the woods, with a bunch of creepy animal sounds all night long, everything was pretty vanilla. Nothing strange, or out of the usual."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","like_work","I work on computers for a full-time job. I like working on computers, because I'm really good at it, but I would definitely prefer a job that would have me working outdoors, as I like the outdoors better. It's a nice job, has great pay, and overall is a nice place to work, so I guess I'm happy."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","religious","I believe in God, and I believe in some of the moral teachings of the bible, but that's it. All I know, is that I love God, God loves me, and when I pass on, it will be to greener pastures. I'm good to people in my life, and try to do my best in general, and that's all that's important to me."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","fire_rescue","I can't answer that, because I wouldn't be able to choose one item. I would just be immensely grateful for my loved ones and pets being safe. To choose one item would literally get me killed in the fire, since I can't decide."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","why_studies","These online studies are a great way to contribute to research, but are an even greater way to generate some side income. My partner and I work to pay the bills, and every little bit helps immensely. Doing these studies is a great way to have some financial wiggle room, so to speak."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","friend_value","I value honesty above all else. I also value someone not afraid to call me out on what I'm saying if they think I'm wrong, or in the wrong. Loyalty is important, too, because I would never want a friend to stab me in the back without justification."
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","last_sing","I think I was singing along with a song last night, actually. I was helping my partner with something, and I had a song stuck in my head, so I sang along to it a little bit. I sing quite a bit for fun, so it's nothing unusual. "
"R_3JsfjAzzy4klUfN","mind_body","Obviously I would want the body of a 30-year-old, with a 90-year-old mind. I want the physical capabilites of my younger self, but all the wisdom and knowledge of my older self. I don't know why anyone would want the opposite."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","cute_baby","I saw a baby crying and attempting to argue with her parent.  It was so cute because I think in her mind she was putting on a great argument but what came out was a bunch of ""goo goo ga ga"" type noises that no adult could truly comprehend.  I think she made a good effort and I respect the baby for trying so hard to assert her case."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","how_raised","I would ask my parents to have disciplined me more harshly.  That sounds strange, I know.  My parents were far to lenient with me and never forced me to do activities unless I wanted to do them.  If they were more strict, I probably would have learned a second language and an instrument."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","mind_body","I would retain the body of a 30 year old because I would think my mind will hold up pretty well in the last 60 years of my life.  I do lots of reading and writing so I'm not worried about my mind aging.  I would value having a healthy body so that I may cook, clean, travel and do all the things I enjoy while I get older."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","famous","No, I would not like to be famous. I am a huge introvert and enjoy my privacy.  I prefer to respect my own accomplishments and do not need validation from others, thus being famous holds no value for me."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","fire_rescue","I would save my sister's journal.  My older sister passed away ten years ago and we saved a journal that she wrote in while she was a teenager.  We never read it but it holds great sentimental value to our family and we cherish having it. I would definitely go back and save her personal belonging."
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the high volume of racist people living in my community.  I am half Asian and I noticed early on as a young girl that my community members felt uncomfortable with people who were different than them.  I think it is strange to be around so many people who do not tolerate differences in cultures, skin tone and accents."

"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","religious","No, I don't consider myself to be religious in any way.  I learned a long time ago that being ""religious"" doesn't mean I'm more moral, closer to God, or more spiritual.  I would rather think of myself as being a spiritual person, not religious. "
"R_3kChWbhrfosN9Xe","friend_value","I value respect.  I think every friendship should consist of two people who genuinely respect one another. Without respect there is nothing and I don't believe it's a true friendship."

"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","religious","I'm not a religious person, but I consider myself a spiritual person. I was raised Catholic, and my family was extremely strict and religious. 
However, as I got older I saw some hypocrisies within organized religion I was never able to rectify within my spiritual self. So, I moved on from religion but retained my spirituality."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","last_sing","That is hard to recall. I often sign or hum to myself, and to my 2 year old daughter. She loved to dance, and sometimes I can hum some music or even beat box and she will dance to it. We often sing those baby songs together, she really loves 'Wheels on the Bus'!
Probably the only time I sing to myself is in the car when a good song comes on, but don't tell anyone!"
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","garden","We have a garden we put together this year, and we love it. We grew tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, squash, and even watermelon.
Everything came in really well, except the watermelon. We planted that too late so sadly there wasn't enough time. Still, we did end up with a lot of everything else and it was nice having fresh vegetables all summer. We ended up canning a lot of it."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","mind_body","That is hard to say! If I make it to 90, I'd probably want to keep my mind intact the most. To forget the people that I know and love would be worse than death, in my opinion. 
While I can expect a painful existence at 90, really it is a good, long life. I'd be happy and thankful."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","fire_rescue","My box with all my pictures probably. It's tough though, because I have a lot of pictures in digital form on my computer as well. Either way, it would be family pictures. Those would be the greatest loss I think because they are irreplaceable and priceless to me."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","cute_baby","My 2 year old daughter seemingly breaks the cuteness record daily. Lately, she is all about dancing, only as a 2 year old can do- and it is rather adorable. She is such a happy child and it's been such a joy. 
Right now, she is dancing to Sesame Street and it is very cute!"
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","famous","When I was younger I dreamed of becoming famous. As I got older, I think that dream has faded. Celebrity is pretty overrated, especially when you'd also like to have a normal family and normal relationships. I'd enjoy the financial security of celebrity more than being actually famous, I think."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","how_raised","I'm not sure. You know what they say- the grass is always greener. My childhood wasn't too bad I guess. There was a lot of physical and emotional abuse so of course I would probably change that. I was also raised in an extremely strict household that went to church 3 times a week, which was difficult to manage with any sort of social life and school."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","friend_value","I probably would value trust the most within any friendship. If there is no trust, there really can't be much else. Trust is the foundation to any relationship, in my opinion. You'd never confide in someone you could not trust!"
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","strangest","There really was nothing strange about growing up in North Jersey. It's not far from New York City, so there was access to everything; but you had the suburban culture you cold only find in 1985 suburbia. 
I guess one of the most strange about Passaic County, New Jersey, is the fact that the night before Halloween is called 'Goosey Night'. It is largely a night of mischief. Houses and cars are egged, toilet paper is thrown in trees, ect. No other place in the country calls that night 'Goosey Night'."
"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","like_work","Right now, I am working in customer service for a large utility company. I really don't like much of anything about it. The pay is bad, the coworkers are mostly annoying, the management is horrible...

"R_3KQ6LUTNopLy1gY","why_studies","I do these studies to make a few extra bucks. I'd like to save up some extra money and upgrade my computer, as well as get a few things I don't 'need' but have wanted for awhile. 
Also, it is a good time waster. I feel more productive doing these studies than simply watching TV. "
"R_3KUaIHtMjUOelPF","why_studies","I do these studies to make some extra cash.  I like to buy things I couldn't otherwise justify spending money on.  I view mTurk money as free money.  Money that I can use to buy toys."
"R_3KUaIHtMjUOelPF","strangest","The strangest thing was how close knit the community was.  I grew up in a very small town.  It always seemed odd to me just how well everyone knew everyone else's business."

"R_3KUaIHtMjUOelPF","mind_body","I would retain the body.  Getting old sucks, things start to ache.  There is a lot of physical discomfort with getting older.  It'd be better to have that young body and deal with the mental issues."
"R_3KUaIHtMjUOelPF","famous","I guess I would like to be famous for helping others.  I'm a computer programmer, so likely any fame I would get would be due to developing some piece of software.  Perhaps I could be famous for inventing the next social media site."

"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","strangest","I grew up in Silicon Valley in the 80's and 90's and it was a very normal place, so describing the strangest thing is a bit challenging.  However, I suppose that I would say that what was the most odd about where I grew up was that all of the homes and high tech companies that were present there, were relatively recent, and built atop what was formerly farmland.  Therefore, there was an IBM Research & Development facility immediately down the street from an orchard and fully-functional farm, with cows and pigs.  The juxtaposition was a bit strange."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","mind_body","I would want to keep the mind of the 30-year-old because my intellect and thoughts and memories are very valuable to me.  I am currently 39 and I am very occasionally starting to forget things, trivial things, such as the titles of songs or the names of celebrities.  I would like to maintain these memories, especially if my children grow up to have their own children, then I would love to be able to fully appreciate my interactions with them and memories of them.  It would seem strange to be a fit 80-year-old who can run around and jump and lift weights, but who then couldn't remember where he parked the car."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","how_raised","If I could change one thing about the way that I was raised, I would have wished that my mother was more connected with my sister and I on a personal level.  My mother never really seemed interested in really listening to us, because she was always busy and stuff always needed to get done.  My father was always there for us to bounce ideas off of, and to help us explore how to process the world around us and our emotions.  However, my mom never did, and all that we could count on her for was keeping the house organized and directing us to do chores."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","fire_rescue","I would grab my computer.  At this point in time, I have a ton of important documents and photos saved on it.  I feel like losing my computer would cause me to lose a lot of memories.  Also, it would make rebuilding our lives difficult not to be able to access the internet and my financial documents."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","last_sing","I last sang to myself while picking up around the house.  I don't remember exactly what I was singing, but it was simply some song that I had heard on the radio.  I also sing to my daughters regularly and frequently.  We often sing improvised songs about whatever we are doing.  This morning, while walking my daughter to school, I sang a song to her about walking to school, and she joined in and improvised some verses of her own."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","religious","I am not a religious person.  I never felt a strong spiritual connection to the faith that I was raised in.  I would pray, and hoped to somehow get guidance from God, but in the end I never really felt anything or got any answers.  My parents are really religious, but I just never understood their desire to go to church or to pray.  It seemed like an empty practice."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is having a strong bond to that friend.  I have many casual acquaintances or friends that I enjoy being around.  However, these friends are not ones that I truly believe will be around forever, and if I were to move to a different city, these more casual friends would likely forget about me, because we are friends due to circumstance, more so than friends with a true bond.  I truly value the friends that I form a life long bond with and maintain that bond with regardless of whatever changes in our lives."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","cute_baby","The cutest thing that I have seen a child do was done by my 2-year-old daughter.  She was sitting on the floor playing on toy piano.  She couldn't play any actual songs, but she would press on about 20 to 30 random keys, then pause, and then clap for herself and shout ""Yay!""  I think that she was pretending to be her own audience.  It was really sweet."

Also, I get to interact with a ton of intelligent people on a daily basis.  I am the one in the lab with the most technical knowledge, so I am always useful to others, which is a great feeling."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","garden","We have a small garden in our backyard.  We took a sandbox and filled it with dirt atop our patio and made a vegetable garden for my daughters.  There are tomatoes and carrots growing in it.  We let my oldest daughter take care of it."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","famous","I would not want to be famous because I don't want that much attention.  I enjoy my privacy and my time alone with my friends and family.  I feel like being famous would result in too much scrutiny and unwanted judgement by others towards all of my decisions."
"R_3KZpeNMKORG4kxK","why_studies","Well, as a researcher myself, I understand the importance of trying to systematically understand a certain phenomenon.  In my particular situation, I investigate biochemical occurrences through the data that I collect with the instruments that I use in our laboratory.  However, many researchers doing these online studies are conducting sociological or psychological studies, for which they need data too!  Therefore, I am happy to contribute to boost the research of others.  In addition, the pay that I get in return allows me to pay down my outstanding student loans a bit faster, and I have even started a reasonable college savings fund for my children using the money that I have earned from these online studies."

"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30 year old. People who grow old don't necessarily have diminished mental capacities, but every single 90 year old has at least some sort of physical disability. Even if they're not medically diagnosed with a disability, they certainly cannot move or react in the same way as a 30 year old. The body is essentially a vessel that allows your brain to move around. There's nothing more scary to me than being lucid and aware, but not being able to move in a competent manner. That's why I would to retain the body; it's the thing that is guaranteed to deteriorate."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","friend_value","Loyalty is the what I value most in a friendship. I think it's even more important than being nice or friendly, because being loyal automatically includes those two things. I'm a very loyal person by nature and I really like it when someone would stick up for me no matter what, especially because I would do the same. I think loyalty is what fosters long-lasting relationships. And I mean relationships of any kind, not just friendship."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","religious","No, I'm not religious in any way. The reason for that is that I don't see any compelling evidence for the existence of a supernatural being or beings that watch over us and created the universe. There's also the fact that the idea of religion is heavily anthropocentric, meaning that places humans as the main focus, as if we are major players in the universe. I study astronomy as a hobby and I have taken astronomy courses. When you learn about the universe and get somewhat of sense of the scale of the universe, and how things work, the idea of supernatural beings becomes absolutely absurd. The idea that humans matter in the grand scheme of things seems unbelievable. Especially considering the fact how humans have lost ""rank"" as being the center of anything. What I mean is that humans used to think the Sun revolved around Earth, but then it was found the opposite was true. Then that the Sun was the center of the galaxy, and that was found to be untrue. Then that the galaxy was the center of the universe, but was found that there likely ISN'T a center of the universe."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","famous","No way, I would never want to become famous in any way. Being famous has the major drawback that people care *too* much about you, so your actions are scrutinized to an absurd extent. Anything you say or do can be twisted and interpreted as having malicious intent. In some cases, you will have people stalking you and snapping photos of you so it can be published in magazines, most likely without your consent. I can't stand the idea of losing my privacy and it's why I abhor the idea of becoming famous. "

It's basically contains a huge chunk of my life stored in the form of data and it's where I keep lots of documents and information.

It would feel like a huge irreplaceable loss if I didn't take it with me."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","garden","Yeah, I actually do have a fruit tree. It's right out in the front of the house, a bit to the side. It's a mango tree and it's one of the things I prize the most. Every summer, it provides a large bounty of sweet, delicious mangoes. These mangoes are big, too. About twice the size of my fist. And when I say ""bounty"", I really mean it. It gets to the point where I have to give a lot of them away to neighbors and friends, otherwise they would rot before I got a chance to eat them."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","how_raised","Oh, I would definitely change the fact that I was not really given much attention as a child. My parents tended to leave me alone to let me do my own thing and when I did confront them with a problem I had, they would downplay or tell me to go away. Thanks to this, I always feel like my problems are not worth mentioning to anyone and that no one would care. Even as an adult, knowing that this really isn't true, having been raised my entire life to think this way, it's very ingrained in my brain and way of thinking and not something I can easily overcome."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","strangest","The strangest things is probably the fact that there was a police station about 3 houses down. No where else have I seen a police station so close by and it's one of the things I loved about my old neighborhood. It made me feel safe knowing that the police were a 30 second walk down the block. I think that's probably why it was so quiet and peaceful where I grew up."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","why_studies","Because my curiosity is insatiable. There is always something to learn, always something to discover. It doesn't need to be a brand new discovery for the whole of humanity, but new to me. One of the most exciting things to me is figuring out why something functions the way it does or questioning things that seem obvious. Studying things online allows me to learn whenever I want, however I want. I feel fortunate to live in a time where I can easily look up information in a vast network, since it allows me to satisfy my curiosity."
"R_3lF8RguOskVxb4r","cute_baby","Well, I honestly don't have much experience around children or babies, but I think the cutest thing is seeing a child try on their parents' clothing. The way the clothes look floppy and loose all over with their tiny limbs not even reaching half-way through the sleeves or pant legs is quite cute. I think it added to the child's image of being innocent."
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","cute_baby","I do not find babies or children to be cute.  Most of what I have seen small children do is throw up or stick their hands in their mouths or one then the other.  This is not something I prefer to see on any regular basis. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","garden","I have no fruit trees or vegetable garden in my yard at the moment, though I have in the past.  I do however have 5 large oak trees in my back yard.  In the front of my yard I have a garden with flowers and herbs mixed together. As well as some flowering trees. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","last_sing","I do not sing, I have no illusions about my ability to carry a tune.  I would not inflict my lack of tone on anyone I know.  I do not sing to myself either, if I were to actively enjoy music I am more likely to dance. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","religious","I am not a religious person.  I have seen too many people behave in hateful ways because their religion seems to have trained them to do so.  I have no need to hide behind such a belief that would make me act so horribly.  Religions have hampered progress and started wars for most of our history. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","mind_body","Could I not have both the mind and the body of a 30 year old?  While it would be wonderful to stay physically young for the rest of my life, I would have to say I'd like the mind of a 30 year old. I have seen the ravages of Alzheimer disease and dementia and would never like to lose my self like that. I would try to stay young in body but definitely stay young in mind.  "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","friend_value","What I most value in a friendship is the understanding you can have with someone.  I appreciate when someone can know when you do not want to talk and not be offended by it. Or even just spend time in a room not doing much of anything, but also willing to have an adventure. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","fire_rescue","If we are sure that my pets are safe and my loved ones are safe in this situation I have a few options.  One, if it's winter and I didn't have time before getting the pets out I may grab some warm clothes and coats.  If that is not an issue I would probably grab either a photo album or some artwork done by my great grandfather for sentimental reasons. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","why_studies","My primary reason for taking these studies is for extra income.  My significant other has been out of work for years.  He also does studies but this is a way for met to make ends meet when my paycheck doesn't cover expenses.  "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","strangest","I don't think there was anything particularly strange about where I grew up.  However I did grow up long enough ago that as children we had free run of the neighborhood.  It was safe enough that we would leave our homes early in the morning to explore an play and not come home until it was dark. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","how_raised","Oh goodness, If I could change anything about how I was raised I might change it so that my parents didn't work all the time.  Both of my parents worked and I would have liked it if we had more time for activities. As it was I spent a large amount of time babysitting my younger siblings and not doing much. "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","like_work","I work in an administrative capacity in a large office. It is not what I enjoy however, I work in my spare time as a wood carver which I enjoy immensely.  Almost every spare moment I have at home I am working on projects, the focus and sense of achievement is perfect.  "
"R_3LiLFXjIhFvHh5d","famous","I would not like to be famous. I know it's a calling for many people but the spot light does not call me.  I prefer to be working on artistic projects in the back ground. "
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","famous","I sometimes imagine how it would feel to be famous. I would like to famous athlete, perhaps a basketball player. It is a hobby of mind. I think I would enjoy playing professionally and getting paid to do what I like. I would not have to worry about finances."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","last_sing","I do not sing to myself. I do enjoy singing along with songs on the radio. The last time I remember singing is in the car this morning. They just started to play Christmas music on the radio."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","fire_rescue","I would run in to grab my safe. I keep a safe with spare cash and valuables. I do not think that it is fire proof. It is easily the object that is worth the most in the house."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","religious","I am religious. I am Christian and I go to church events regularly. I believe in a god that created humanity. I also believe that there is a life after this current one."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","strangest","I grew up in Chicago Illinois. We lived in a three story apartment. I think the strangest thing about where I grew up are the cat sized rats that were in the back alley of our apartment. They would dive into the dumpsters to eat garbage."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","like_work","I work as an electrical engineer for a consulting firm. I work on schematics design for utility companies. I enjoy that every project is challenging and different. There is not one defined way to do the work. I also like how work requires communication with the client and communication between team members."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","garden","I do not have a fruit tree, plants, or gardens currently. I used to have a hobby of growing flowers in my patio. I grew sunflowers and other common flowers. The squirrels would eat the sunflowers once the seeds started to form."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","why_studies","I do these online studies so that I can earn some extra cash. I like shopping on Amazon, but I also do not like to use my credit card. The money I earn through Mturk funds whatever purchases I decide to make on Amazon. It's a way I justify online shopping."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do is trying to dress up for work like their parents. My baby cousin went into his dad's closet and tried to put on his dress clothes and shoes, which were way too big for him. It is cute because he imitating what grown ups do when he is only 3 years old."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","how_raised","If I could change the way I were raised, I wish that my parents would push me to do more extracurricular activities. I enjoyed school, but I am only now realizing that being proactive would have made the experience even more enjoyable. Also, I wish to think that I would be a lot better at my current hobbies had I started at an earlier age, such as basketball, fixing cars, and music. "
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","friend_value","I value loyalty the most in a friendship. The friend that sticks with you no matter the circumstance is the most valuable. There are friends that are only your friend to get something out of the relationship. A relationship with a loyal friend lasts a lifetime."
"R_3Lj8TQHhoYktZru","mind_body","I would like to have the body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of my life. I think that as long I do not have any mental illnesses, then the only limitation would be my physical capacity. Even if I had the mind of a 30 year old, my body would be frail and would not be able to do the things I a young person would want to do."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","religious","No, I'm not. My mother converted to Christianity when I was pretty young. I was never really into religion though. As I've grown older, I've come to terms with the fact that I'm an atheist. I simply cannot rationalize something like a God possibly existing personally."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","garden","No, I don't. I've thought about it though. I love cooking so the prospect of growing something was always appealing to me. I don't know how feasible it would be to grow trees or full blown plants would be considering the space I have, but something like herbs would be fun."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","friend_value","I think that honesty is the most valuable thing to have in any relationship at all. Your words are practically all you have in relationships. If those words hold no truth at all, then you practically have nothing between you and the person you're trying to bond with."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","last_sing","I sang to myself today actually. I'm a terrible singer, but I absolutely love music. So I think it's fair to say I sing to myself more or less every single day."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","mind_body","I would much more prefer to keep the mind. While sad, it's kind of a rule of thumb that as you get older your mind starts to go a little bit. While having a sore and old body isn't very pleasant, being able to think without being hindered by my age would be nice."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","why_studies","Whenever I have some free time I do them for a bit of extra cash. Then I can spend it on things for fun that I can't spend my other income on. I get to just pick and choose what I want to do, and sometimes the studies are even a bit fun."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","how_raised","I was really sheltered for a while until I was more than half way through middle school. I didn't get to really go outside often or go to school events. While I don't feel like it had any long term negative effects on me, I would have liked to experience those parts of my early childhood."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","fire_rescue","Probably my desktop. Not only is my computer heavily upgraded and one of my most expensive possessions, it has a lot of valuable information on it as well. I also do nearly all my work from my computer, so it's invaluable for that reason too."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","famous","That's a tough one. I think I would like to be famous, maybe for stand up comedy or something like that. The last thing I would want is for the fame to get to my head though. I guess overall, I would like to be famous, but if it started to change who I was I'd lose interest immediately."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","cute_baby","I saw this video of a baby purposely pretending to cry while their nails were being clipped to scare their dad. They kept doing it because it was funny to them. Something about a baby kind of sharing humor in a way you wouldn't expect them to is really cute."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","like_work","I mainly freelance, finding work where I can. I love being able to push myself to work as hard as I personally want to. Being able to choose my hours is also a huge plus. Working from home can be stressful in it's own way, but it's equally as rewarding at times."
"R_3lQ9e7POgmSMhEH","strangest","I think the strangest thing about where I grew up was the community overall. It really felt like there was a little bit of ""everyone"" there, if that makes sense. People from every culture, from every group, every stereotype even. It created a sort of cool vibe, but it's bizarre to have this giant melting pot in such a small area."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","cute_baby","Oh goodness that's a hard question to answer! All babies are cute, but obviously I think my son was the cutest. When he was little he loved to watch Wheel of Fortune, it was so cute the way he would follow along like he knew what was happening!"
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","mind_body","This is a really tough question. I'm already past having the body of a 30 year old, and I miss being able to do a lot of the things I used to take for granted. While I wouldn't want my mind to be completely gone, like with Alzheimers, I don't think that having the mind of a 90 year old is so terrible. My grandmother is 98 and does just fine. So I think I would definitely want to keep the body of a 30 year old."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","garden","Since I rent I don't have any fruit trees. But I do have a few house plants and a lot of plants in my yard. And every spring or summer I plant a few vegetable plants, usually tomatoes because they're easy to grow and every useful."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","strangest","I grew up in a very small town where there were a lot of farmers. There was only one blinking light in the middle of our town. But the most strange thing was that our school had only one building for all grades k-12."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","fire_rescue","I never thought about this, because honestly my son and my pets are too important to my to ever risk going back into a burning building. I would be too busy taking care of them and getting responders to the scene to think I would want to risk my life to go back into the house. But if I could only save one thing, it would probably be my purse. Replacing my phone, IDs, and everything in it would be so hard after a fire."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","last_sing","I don't know if I sing much anymore. I do sing to my son often, usually to joke around with him. But I'm certain that the last time I sang aloud was to myself in the car, singing along with something on the radio."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","religious","I am not a religious person at all. I was raised Catholic and tried to be religious when I was a teen. But my questions about religion began early on, and only grew as I went through early adulthood and in college. After years of exploration, questioning, and discussion with friends, I decided that religion is mostly a way for the people in control to keep control over the masses. "
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","famous","When I was little I wanted to be famous. I thought I would be a famous actress or singer, or maybe an ice skater. But now that I'm older, I value my privacy too much to want to be famous, especially to be some sort of Hollywood celebrity. I think the only way I would want to be famous would be if it were because of good deeds or works that I have done."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","how_raised","That is a bit of a difficult question. I try not to live my life with any regrets. But if I could change one thing about the way I was raised, it would be that I wish I had been in a school where I had been more challenged. I found high school to be extremely easy, and as a result I didn't know how to study when I got to college."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is honesty. It it very easy for me to strike up a friendship with almost anyone. But when I find someone who can be truly honest with me, even about things that aren't easy to discuss, then I know that person is someone I want to keep around."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","why_studies","I do these online studies mostly to earn a little bit of money. I've been surprised how easy it is to earn more than I thought I would. However, I have also learned that through answering these questions I'm learning a lot about myself and  what's really important to me. I have also surprised myself by deciding to not do quite a few of them, even if I would make money from them."
"R_3LYFRMz7BQrIz81","like_work","Right now I'm working as an EMT. I love this job, I think it's my calling and probably what I should have been doing my whole life. I love that there is something different to do and think about on every call, and I'm always challenged. But more importantly I love working with my patients. Sometimes all I can do is hold the hand of someone who's scared about what's happening to them, but those are often the times that I feel most rewarded."
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","cute_baby","The cutest thing that i have seen a child do was just smile at me and give me a hug.  It was a very little baby probably 2 years old.  The reason it was so cute was because i did not know the baby . "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","famous","Yes i would like to be famous.  Specifically i would like to be an actor.  The reason behind this is because i could star in movies and be well known around the world."
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","why_studies","I do these online studies to pass the time.  I also do them because i find it more enjoyable than watching tv.  Also it does help with making some extra cash on the side. "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","strangest","The strangest thing was the city i grew up in.  It was very run down in a very bad area.  Lots of violence when i was growing up . "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","mind_body","I would like to retain my mind.  The reason is becaue i would still want the memories .  Without memories what is the meaning of life . "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","garden","I do not have any fruit trees.  The reason behind this is because i do not have a secttion in my back yard for them. If i did have a big back yard i would consider this. "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","religious","Yes i am very religious .   I think that i am this way because of the way that i grew up while being a kid.  I am like this just based on how my parents raised me. "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","how_raised","I would change how i acted when i was a child.  Specifically i would change how i views life.  I would also change my confidence i did not have much growing up ."
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","last_sing","The last time that i sang to myself was a few days ago.  I was in the shower and i was in a very great mood and just started singing.  This just kind of happened ranomly . "
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","fire_rescue","This one item would be  a blanket that my mother made for me.  This item is very important to me thats why i would save this one.   If i didn't grab this item i would have so much regret."
"R_3lyshoL5qCKW6Nb","friend_value","In friend ship i value trust the most .  I think that trusting someone is a big key to friendship.  This will allow you to share your deepest secrets . "

My gold coins.
They have value and mean something."

It was a Native American reservation.
Yet half the people were white living with Natives."

A correction officer at a NY prison.
I like the people i work with."
"R_3M3Bw827KIwQDkB","mind_body","If i was able to live to 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30 year old, i would choose.
The body.
I might loose the mind, but boy i would have some fun."

The baby loved the bacon.

"R_3M3Bw827KIwQDkB","how_raised","I would change about the way i was raised.
The divorce of my parents.
A father and mother presence is better for children."

Yes.
I sence and feel the presence of God."

At the bar last Friday.
It was Karaoke night. "

No, do not have the time for those.
I do have plants though, they just need water and sun light."

It is convenient.
And it saves me money."
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","last_sing","I honestly cant remember the last time I actually sung out loud. I sing to myself a lot in my own head, and I probably did that this morning without actually realizing it. I get songs stuck in my head a lot but never sing them out loud. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that is a very small town. We only had a few thousand people in my city, and we had almost nothing to do. There was no mall, no bowling alley, no movie theater, and no real place for kids to hang out. There were only 4 other kids in my high school graduating class. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","famous","I would not ever want to be famous. I am not at all interested in being in the spotlight or being recognized for anything. I want to stay at home in my pajamas and live my life for me. "

She didn't understand at first and was vert confused, and then looked up at us confidently as she finally got a taste of the banana. Her eyes lit up and she smiled as she tried another piece. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","fire_rescue","I would run in and grab my photo albums. I would choose that because it is the only thing that contains photos of my family and those that I have lost. I would be devastated if I lost many of the old photos I have of my father and mother. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","like_work","I am a clerical typist at a small accounting firm. I like my job because it is a very relaxed environment and I can do most of my work from anywhere. Its important work but I never feel stressed or like I am being forced to do something that is impossible. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","religious","I am not a religious person for many reasons. Growing up I was never forced to go to church or believe in any certain thing. I was allowed to make up my own mind about what I thought and believed, and as i got older I found that no religion or teachings ever made me feel like I needed them in my life. Its just not something that is valuable to my life. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","why_studies","I like to do these online studies because it is a great way for me to relax and make some extra money. I have a lot of fun with them because they ask interesting questions or have you play fun elaborate games. Its low stress and a better use of my time than anything else. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","friend_value","I value understanding most in a friendship. I am a difficult person to be friends with because I am very much a hermit and like my alone time. When someone understands me and still makes the effort to be my friend, and appreciates my efforts as well, is what I value the most. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","garden","I have no garden or trees, sadly. I live in a climate where growing your own food or plants is almost impossible. I do have a few trees in my yard from the previous owners, but they never need any care from me to thrive. "
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","how_raised","I had a great childhood and honestly would not change much about how I was raised. One thing that bothers me now as I am much older is that not much emphasis was put on extended family. My extended family was not in contact with us nor were we with them for several reasons I may never know. That is probably the only thing I would change, everything else i remember fondly."
"R_3mAi38F528ywC6B","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30 year old I think. Both are attractive but I would be very concerned about the degeneration of my bones and health issues that arise when you get older. It would be frustrating to have the mind of a 30 year old but be unable to do anything because you have the body of a 90 year old. "
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","fire_rescue","I would save my ice skates in a disaster if that was the only non-living item I could save. I bought them used decades ago and they are in poor condition, but they would be expensive to replace and they are better than rental skates. They represent to me my athletic self, something that I developed only in adulthood, as well as initiative, pleasure and self-esteem. When I am skating I feel in harmony with my true self."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","how_raised","The one thing I would change about the way I was raised is the psychological and physical abuse. My life would have been totally different. I would have been able to flourish. Instead, I have lived in poverty, fear and ostracism, because family members and society generally are organized to perpetuate and enforce the abuse. For example, the only family member who contacts me by phone during the holiday season is an abuser now in his eighties"
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","why_studies","I do these online studies, turk work, solely to earn essential money to survive. I am unable to get other work right now because I'm female. When I look back I can see that I've been overqualified, in the view of society, for over three decades for any work women are allowed to do unless they have an appropriate subordinate connection to a powerful man."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","last_sing","I last sang to myself last night as I was getting ready to go to sleep. It puts me in a positive mood. The last time I sang for ""someone"" else was to a dog I was in-house pet-sitting for about three years ago. The dog is the only other being who has ever seemed to enjoy my singing."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","friend_value","I value friendship for the positive give and take more than for any other reason. I like to share mutually enjoyable activities. But what I like the most is the interaction, conversation and exchange of perspectives."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","religious","I am a religious person. It just seems to be my natural viewpoint. Religion gives me so much comfort and guidance in my daily life. It gives me perspective on my place in the world and my life's meaning. I am not authoritarian or dogmatic at all, and have converted once to a different religion. I also minored in religion in college, so I have a skeptical view of religious ceremonies, trappings and dogma. But I also have a strong religious belief and practice."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","mind_body","I would want the mind of a 90-year-old and the body of a 30-year-old if I could have these at the age of 90. I love dancing and sports and hope to enjoy them into advanced old age, even with an aging body, but the younger body would be delightful. I want the mind I have developed over all these years of living, not the  less-experienced or less-knowledgeable mind of a 30-year-old."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","like_work","Right now, the only work I can get is turk work, online task work. The only things I like about it are that it allows me to survive and there is no employer or coworker complaining that I'm not stupid enough and that I get along with people too well. It is extremely low paying."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","cute_baby","I think the cutest thing I've seen a child do is what my youngest brother did when he saw the ocean for the first time. He did not say a word after we got out of the car and toted our picnic to an open pavilion at the beach. He just walked over to the edge of the railing and leaned his arms on it and, without moving, watched the waves come in for about ten minutes."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was how many kids in my school class lived within a quarter mile of me, about a three block radius. It was the middle of the baby boom. When I think back I can recall at least 19, including me. These were all in my class, not the year ahead or behind me."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","famous","I would not like to be famous. Rich, yes; famous, no. Being famous destroys one's privacy and creates tremendous pressure with few to no benefits. Poet Emily Dickinson compared it to being a frog in a pond."
"R_3Mb4oMn6p6UiYiw","garden","No, I have no fruit trees, plants or garden. I have never been able to afford a place to live that offers these opportunities. I do have a fond memory of my grandfather taking me out to the community ""truck farm"" to help when I was a child."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","fire_rescue","If I had to save one item, it would be my quilt made by my grandma. She was the best quilt maker and it brings back a lot of memories. It's a great family heirloom I would love to keep in the family. "

"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","why_studies","I do these online studies because it's great to get a little side money when I have free time. Some days at work it is slow so I do these to kill time. I always give my full attention and only do them when I absolutely know I can finish. I have my own personal office that is very quiet and no one bothers. I also do these at home when I am bored and it's easy to make a quick buck or two. I have a home office where I am very comfortable doing them."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is there was A LOT of farms around. There's so much land in between houses that I only grew up knowing 2 neighbors. There was actually more animals than people in my area!"
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a child do is my niece Jasmine, she made us desert one time after dinner. She really wanted to try so I went ahead and helped her. We made brownies and cookies and it was a lot of fun! It took us 2 batches because we burned the first one together. It was funny and we still talk about it."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","how_raised","If I could change anything about the way I was raised it would be to get raised in a city versus the farm life. We had a school nearby that I went to but back at home, it was just me and my animals to play with on most days. I had a neighbor friend who was a few years older than me but that was about it. We did have great times though and I'm still great friends with him now."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","mind_body","I would want to retain my mind at 30 years old. I'd rather keep the memories than keep the body personally. It would be a tough decision but I can see myself choosing the mind. The body will still be there at 90 but it'll just have more issues. I don't want a mind that's forgetful. "
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","last_sing","I sing to myself every morning when I'm getting ready for work. I have a music player in my kitchen and every morning, when I'm getting ready for work, I play the music player. I love all genres so I can listen to anything. To someone else, would be my wife. I sing to her from time to time. Last week was probably the last time when we were cleaning up the house together."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","religious","I try and be religious when I can. The problem is I'm so busy with family things that most of the time I cannot attend church. I do try and make it when I can with my family. My family does enjoy going to church when we can make it."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","garden","I have an apple tree that's been in my yard for many years. The previous owner put it in and it still grows amazing apples every year. I don't care much for gardening. My wife does a little here and there. To me, I'm just happy with that tree."
"R_3MDqn0h0rgGfUWF","famous","I wouldn't actually like to be famous. I enjoy my life as it is being a nobody right now. Me and my wife are great and happy together.  If I had to choose a way, I would choose being a singer but I'd be fine not being famous."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","how_raised","I think something I would change about the way I was raised would be for my parents to allow me a little more independence.  My mother, especially, did probably too much for me.  Although, I appreciated all she did do, I could've done more for myself.  We had a few chores, etc., but not much responsibility besides getting our school work done, which was the most important to them."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is just being able to feel connected to that person.  To be able to talk about anything, openly and honestly, and wanting them to also feel that way.  To feel connected when you're having so much fun, and when things are tough."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, although that would be neat. I do have some plants that grow in my garden when weather permits.  I have a mix of perennials and annuals.  In the spring, I like to see how the perennials are looking, and then I choose which plants and flowers I want to buy to add in."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","cute_baby","One particular time I can remember was when my baby cousin was in the jumper. It was suspended from the molding of our doorway.  She was so tiny, but could get it going so fast. I had never seen a baby do that before.  As we watched, my mother said that was a first for her also seeing a baby go that wild in it. It was pretty cute."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","religious","I am religious in my belief in God.  I have read the bible a few times and have written a few ""topics"" on it.  I don't attend church on a regular basis and haven't for some time.  I don't believe you have to go to church to have that belief.  I live my life in an honest, moral, always ethical way.  "
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","strangest","I don't think there is anything strange about where I grew up.  I grew up in an average neighborhood, in a medium sized city.  I have both parents, an older sister, and we had a golden retriever.  I went to a good public school, played little league baseball, and enjoyed many other sports. Nothing really strange that I could think of."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","why_studies","I do these online studies to compliment my income. I have a very small business that I started a couple of years ago and I really don't make a lot of money. This helps in allowing me to continue doing what I love.  I feel the studies are also an interesting way to make a bit of money.  There are so many different types of studies, and I feel it gives me the opportunity to learn about many different subjects."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","mind_body","I think I would choose the mind.  I think the ability to always think clearly is so important. Although I am very active and would want to maintain that, I would rather be able to think, communicate, remember, etc. "
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","last_sing","I really don't sing, so I haven't sang to anyone.  I guess the last time I would have sang to myself was driving in the car.  I have to have the music on, and I'm sure I have sang a time or two."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","like_work","I started a small business. I actually buy and sell items through an online platform.  I love the whole aspect of working for myself and seeing how my business has grown.  Although, I am not making a ton of money, I hope that it continues to grow and be successful."
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","fire_rescue","I would probably grab my laptop.  This contains all of my work information in it.  After knowing loved ones and pets are safe, I guess this would be something I would grab. "
"R_3MfJRuKmDRpYUpC","famous","I really don't have any aspirations to be famous. I know a lot of people want that for themselves, but I am not one of them.  I just want to live my life, enjoy what I am doing, and enjoy my family and friends."
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","garden","Yes, I have a garden. In the garden there is tomatoe, berries, cucumbers and more. We also have two peach trees"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","like_work","I work on Amazon mTurk for work. I actually make really good money. I enjoy being able to work whenever I want"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","strangest","It had to be that I grew up in an area that had very big economic divides, being in New York City. That was always a strange thing. Very poor and very rich people."
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","famous","I wouldn't like to be famous. There is no reason to be famous. I just want to be known as someone that did good."
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","last_sing","I sing all the time in the car. I love music and listening to it. I always have it turned up loud"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","how_raised","I wouldn't change anything. I think we have to do the best with what is given to us. That is what should be"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","mind_body","I'd say mind as that is what keeps you alive. I would be in fear of losing my mind. That would be bad
"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","why_studies","I do them for a few reason. First, I make money and that is good. Second, I like thinking about things.."
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","cute_baby","Everything they do is cute. Babies are just honest and do what they want to do. That is the best"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","fire_rescue","I would save all my firearms. It is a big hobby of mine and I enjoy them. I also have lots of money in them"
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","religious","I am because that is the way I group up. I learned a lot and researched a lot about my religion. It is important to me. "
"R_3Mg7LsNRdvLVGea","friend_value","There are several things I value most in friendship. One is honesty and just being honest. Another is being loyal to your friend"
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","like_work","I'm a merchandiser for a local grocery store. I go in, take out discontinued items and bring new products to the shelves. I like the early mornings and when I have short shifts. I get to spend a lot of time enjoying my day after work."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","last_sing","I sang just last night. I love music and I like to sing and dance. I used to sing to my budgie, but he's no longer around so now I just sing to myself."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","garden","No, I don't. My family has tried to grow a garden multiple times. Be it soil or critters nothing grows."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","mind_body","That's an easy one: my mind. If I had the body of a 30-year old I'd have people way too young flirting with me, and I'd have the mind of a 90-year old. I'd much prefer brains over looks."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","fire_rescue","That's easy, my stuffed beanie baby named Muffin. Out of all my possessions he means the most to me. I could never part with him."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","religious","That's a bit of a tricky question. I DO believe in God, as far as the Protestant God goes, but I don't read the Bible or attend church. I have a harder time believing in Heaven and Hell; that our actions will either keep us up in the clouds or damned to torture forever."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","strangest","Well, to begin with I must say I hope you believe in the supernatural. Otherwise this is going to sound strange. It'll sound strange anyway, but here goes: I grew up in a haunted house. It was not uncommon to hear disembodied sounds or see shadowy figures in the corner of your eye. "
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","how_raised","I wish my parents were more outgoing. If they'd set up more play dates back then I'd have a lot more friends. Aside from that my childhood was ideal."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","famous","I'd love to be famous! To be more precise, I'd love for my cartoon to be popular once I get it green-lit. I don't need my face on the camera but I won't mind my show!"
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","cute_baby","I find is adorable when a baby begins to talk. Especially when they can't say the whole word but you get an idea. My little cousin calls ambulances 'amber-lamps'."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","why_studies","I like to make some money on the side. I work a part-time job and work commissions as an artist, but sometimes that just doesn't cut it. I do a few surveys every day and they add up."
"R_3MR8iWHntMPLrKm","friend_value","Mostly that we'd always be there for eachother. I understand personal matters and work and such get in the way sometimes. However when all is said and done what matters most is that we have eachother."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","mind_body","I would rather retain the body of a 30 year old.  One of my favorite hobbies is makeup and beauty products.  In my spare time I watch tutorials, play with different products, shop for new products.  I find it so much fun.  So I want to stay young and pretty so I can continue to enjoy looking in the mirror."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","friend_value","I value trust most in a friendship.  I like to have a good time, and I would want to be friends with someone I have fun with as well.  But most important is trust.  I have a hard time trusting people so a friend I trust is like gold."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","religious","I was raised Catholic, but I don't consider myself to be religious.  I don't attend church, unless it is for a funeral or a wedding.  And I don't ever pray."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","why_studies","A little over a year ago I got into a bad accident and was unable to work for nearly 3 months.  So while I was stuck in bed being depressed I decided to look for jobs online.  When I came across MTurk it was the first online job that actually seemed legit.  And now I still do it for extra money.  And some of the studies are interesting."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","garden","I have many indoor plants.  Several roses and many succulents.  In the summer I always plant flowers around the yard and in flower boxes.  And Someday I would like to start a garden with vegetables."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","how_raised","I would have had a closer relationship with my father.  But that was his choice, to never really try and have a relationship with me.  So I try not to feel to bad about that.  Luckily my mother remarried and my step-father is not a bad guy.  He really likes spending time with my fiance."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","fire_rescue","I would make a dash to our safe.  That is where we keep all our extra money.  So we would need that in the worst way.  "
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","last_sing","I can't really remember the last time I sang to myself.  It was probably while I was cleaning though, alone in the house.  But usually I sing to my dog rather then myself, because she follows me around the house."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","famous","I would never want to be famous.  I am more of an introvert, my fiance is the extrovert.  I like to just keep to myself.  A few years ago my fiance had an opportunity to have a reality show about him, and he was all for it.  But they stopped interviewing him once they found out I was not willing to have any part of it.  He still is hurt about it and brings it up, but I can't help the way I am.  And I would not be able to stand being on T.V."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","cute_baby","I have seen my best friend's baby pet my dog.  She loves my dog , and it is so cute.  I have a little jack russell terrier that loves children.  They are the cutest thing together."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","strangest","I grew up in the most normal, cookie-cutter neighborhood ever.  I don't think there was anything strange about it at all.  I loved where I grew up and really can't think of one thing that was strange about it."
"R_3MyfCAABIalFvpq","like_work","Right now I am working as a waitress in a local restaurant.  I like it in the summer when the town is busy.  I live in a tourist town, so in the summer the restaurant does very well.  But in the winter it is very slow and kind of depressing.  But there isn't much else for work in this town unless I wanted to go back to working on a farm.  And I really don't want to do that."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","famous","I always thought I wanted to be famous, but for something respectable. I could be the first woman to do something. I have a problem with really caring about what other people think about me though, so I'd probably be constantly depressed about what I read about myself in Facebook comments. "
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","garden","I have what's called a black thumb. I think I'm honestly too lazy to tend to a plant every day. I think it'd definitely spruce up the house, but I honestly just hate weeding and watching over them. I have too many living things in my house to worry about, let alone having flowers to tend to."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","why_studies","I do these studies to supplement our household income, if I'm being honest. I'm a stay at home mom, I don't get paid for what I do, and diapers are expensive! I love being able to say, ""I put $X in our bank account today!"" It makes me feel as if I'm contributing."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","friend_value","I value loyalty in my friendships. I think with that comes a sense of never being judged, which is something I really need. It is someone who will stick by you regardless of what mistakes or poor choices you've made. "
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","fire_rescue","I'd have to grab my external hard drive off my computer. I asked for it for Christmas specifically for that reason. I wanted to have all my pictures and important documents backed up, so if there was a fire and I lost my computer, I could still take my hard drive with me."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","how_raised","I worked in my parent's company from the time I was about seven until I was well into my college years. It caused a lot of fights and arguments, because it was an everyday occurrence. I'd have to get home from school, do my homework, and then go to work. It taught me a lot of responsibility but I also lost some of the carefree nature you get as a child."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","last_sing","I usually sing to myself when I'm doing housework. I was actually just cleaning up the living room when a song popped into my head and I belted it out. I sing to my son when I'm getting him ready for bed to try to distract him from moving around too much. He has actually gotten to the stage of telling me to stop, which is pretty rude.  "
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","like_work","I'm a stay at home mom. It's pretty hard, harder than when I used to work actually. I do have lots of bonding time with my son though. Plus, I get to just up and go to the park or a play date or the store at the drop of a hat."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","mind_body","Oh, I'd want the mind for sure! What am I going to do with the body of a 30 year old. I'm 30 now and don't look that great, why would I want to look like this forever? If I kept my mind, I'd have all my memories and could be sharp as a whip."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","religious","I used to be really religious, but now it's kind of dwindled. I still abide by the same morals as I was taught in Sunday School, but it's just hard for me to believe that Jesus ever walked the Earth. I need scientific evidence to believe. I can't just rely on stories from the Bible."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","cute_baby","Oh my gosh, my son used to make the cutest face. When he was a newborn and developing expressions, he used to pout out his bottom lip every time he was about to cry. You could always tell the tears were about to come because he looked so pitiful."
"R_3MyuDNt6aeRnOrx","strangest","I grew up in a lower income community, so there were a lot of drop outs, druggies, and people who just generally didn't care about anything. It was weird to me because I'm a bit of an overachiever, so I could never really understand how they lived like that. You just see lots of decrepit cars, houses that are falling down, and yards that look straight out of a trailer park."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","how_raised","I would have my parents not use corporal punishment on me and my brother. I believe this caused many bad behaviors in me and my brother in childhood. I love my parents and know they did the best they could. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","religious","Yes, I believe in God. I was raised Christian and left god out of my life for the longest time, till I needed him. Then I asked him for help, and he was there for me. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","famous","No, I would not want to be famous. The paparazzi would constantly be harassing me and I like my privacy. Maybe I would like to be a famous bass fisher winning tournaments so I wouldn't be in the main stream public eye and would still get to do something I love. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","strangest","In my town parents let their children leave the house whenever and not come back till after dark. They never kept up with us and we turned out great. There was no cell phones or internet. Also, once there was a mountain lion siting. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","mind_body","I would want the body of a 30 year old. I want my mind to keep getting older and gaining wisdom. I want my body to stay the same so I can keep bagging hot chicks."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","last_sing","I sing quietly to myself when I am alone with my headphones in. I hardly ever sing in public as I don't want to be rude. I cannot remember the last time I sang to someone else."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","like_work","I work on Mturk. I like being able to work when I want as much or little as I want. I like how some of my skills are better since starting, like typing and sorting. I like I do not have to answer to a boss."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","garden","Yes, I grew a big patch of okra this year. I also have a pot with a bushy basil plant and one with a scrawny sage plant. My pumpkin vines were killed by squash vine borers. I plan on growing more next year, including wild flowers."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","cute_baby","I don't really have one answer for that. About everything a child or baby does is cute as long as they are not screaming. One of my sons first words was ""cookie"". He said this as we were shopping and passing the cookie section, except he said ""cooka""."
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","fire_rescue","I would grab my laptop. I use it to earn money so this is very important. With my laptop I could at least survive for the time being. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","friend_value","I value closeness. Experiences you share with someone, whether good or bad brings you together. Familiarity with a person can not be bought or faked, only created. "
"R_3nAy3c6pzvsxsE7","why_studies","I use these to pay my daily needs. I own my own house so all I need to pay are utilities and food/ clothing. I earn enough daily for all this and a little extra. I do my best at these studies and do find them interesting sometimes. "
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","how_raised","I would change the environment I was raised in. I would like to have been raised with less emphasis on religion. I missed out on some good things and was generally not a good person when I used to be religious."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","fire_rescue","It would be really hard for me to decide. I have some expensive stuff, but I don't have that many sentimental things. I guess I would probably save my computer since it has a lot of important stuff on it. "
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","why_studies","I do these studies for a couple of reasons. One being I'm really bored during the day and don't have much going on. I mainly do it for some extra money though. I especially need some extra cash for Christmas shopping."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","famous","I'm not too concerned with fame. If I did become famous I would want it to be for a good reason. Such as making a major scientific breakthrough."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","garden","I wish I was able to have a garden. Unfortunately I live in an apartment so I can't grow anything outside. Hopefully one day I'll have my own place where I can plant anything I want."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","cute_baby","I've seen them do some cute things before so it's hard to say. If I had to choose though, it would probably be my friend's niece playing with animals. It's really cute to see animals and children getting along. "
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","friend_value","It's hard to say what I value most. I would have to say them having similar interests to me. It would be hard to be friends with people that don't share my interests."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","strangest","I grew up in a pretty uneventful area. There really wasn't too many strange things going on. I guess the strangest thing would be the fact that the whole area is full of Amish people always on the roads. "
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","mind_body","That is a difficult question. I think I would have to choose the mind of a 30-year-old. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my time if I didn't have a clear mind."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","religious","I am not a religious person. I just don't see a need for anyone to be religious. It just seems like an outdated concept. Also I have seen the damage religion can do to people so I don't want any part of that."
"R_3NQd00bCHf758yu","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was a few days ago when I was the only one at my place. I never sing in front of other people though. I find that to be too embarrassing. "

"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","cute_baby","I don't know what the cutest thing I've seen a baby do. I have a 1 year old son at home, and he does cute things all the time. Trying to rank the cutest things he, or any baby, does, is damn near impossible."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","why_studies","To make money. I am currently trying to make enough money to get other business ventures off the ground. I also am a stay-at-home-parent, and have worked at home well before I was a parent. I also have really bad social anxiety, so this is a perfect fit for me, until I can get other things going."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","famous","I would like to be famous, but in an anonymous sort of way. I'd like people to know who I am, but not in the ""OMG, it's so and so!"" way. Rather, I want to people to know that I am a knowledgeable person, an influential figure, but also retaining my privacy."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","like_work","I do work (mostly studies) on MTurk. I like it because I can work from home, and I'm on the computer. I also write scripts to help me find work, which is especially fulfilling, as my success with script writing directly correlates with my earnings."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","friend_value","Listening and compassion. So many of my friendships feel one sided, or at least have, since I don't actively have many friendships. I feel like when I listen to others and have compassion for them and their issues, I'm rarely met with the same thing when I need it."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","strangest","The strangest thing was probably when I lived down south. I've lived up north most of my life, but for about 6 months, we moved to West Virginia, and the animals, landscape, scenery, and people down there were almost foreign to me. I remember one time coming home from school, and seeing a deadly water snake (don't know the species) floating down the creek going through my back yard. Never seen anything like that up north."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","fire_rescue","Probably my work computer. My work computer contains many, many scripts that I've written in the last few years, which are necessary for my work. Saving my computer is only not an option if I have to choose between it and my family."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","last_sing","The song 'Eye For An Eye' by Nightingale. I love that song, and the whole album the song is on. I sang to myself, because my singing voice sucks, and I don't sing in front of others."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","garden","No, unfortunately I don't. Due to my current living situation, I do not have a yard to plant any plants, trees, or garden. Maybe someday, if I'm lucky, I'll have a yard that I can plant things in, and call my own."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","religious","Absolutely not. I think religion is a crock of shit. I believe that, we as humans, make up the stories that form the basis of religion because we are scared of the unknown. I would love to think that there is a place for good people to go after they die, and for bad people to suffer when they die, but in all honesty, we really don't know, and I don't think it's possible to know."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","mind_body","I would choose the body. I love my mind, and would love to be able to retain it, but I'm scared of the physical ailments that come with aging. Particularly, I'm scared of the doctors visits, possible surgeries, and complications that come with aging."
"R_3nTAqcgQ0b8kMBW","how_raised","I would change my father's willingness to be there for my during my childhood. He claims that he wasn't around because he was busy working, and because he couldn't handle my mom. However, I think it's complete and utter bullshit, and that he used that as a cop-out for his own lack of character."
"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","strangest","I grew up in a rural area, so there wasn't a lot of strange things. Our neighbor was a little weird, he set up a bed and breakfast which nobody ever seemed to stay at. He also set up part of  his land across the road as a nature preserve."
"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","religious","I am a religious person, as I feel like there's some overarching force that guides us in the universe. It took me a while to move from spiritual to religious, but once I found the right church it made me believe fully. I try not to push my beliefs on other people though. "
"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","fire_rescue","I would go grab the box of sentimental stuff my wife keeps in the basement. Her memories of her grandmother are in there and they are very important to her. I would hate to see her lose them."

"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","friend_value","I value the companionship and knowing that if you have a problem somebody is going to be there to listen to you. It helps having somebody who can give you their take on an issue. And it's good to have somebody to  hang out with."
"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","how_raised","I would have liked my mom to have pushed me out of the house earlier than I was. I stayed at home forever and was sheltered a little bit which lead me to making some terrible decisions for myself. Other than that my childhood was pretty good."
"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","cute_baby","I love when a newborn gets tipped backwards the fling their arms out to the sides. It's an instinctual reaction, but it's really cute. especially when it happens in elevators."

"R_3NVtyAyxLLHtKZ4","mind_body","I would want the mind of a 30 year old. The thing that scares me with getting old is losing my mind. If I lose some ability in my body, that's ok, I don't use a lot of it anyway."
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","how_raised","I would probably have to say that I would change the amount of freedom that my parents gave me. When I was growing up, my parents were over protective of me and I think this affected me a bit later in life. I think it would have been fine to give me more responsibility and freedom than they did. "
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was this morning on my way to work. I find myself singing along with the radio on my commute. I honestly can't remember the last time I sang to somebody else though."
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","garden","No, I don't have any fruit trees or a garden. I live in an apartment complex, so I don't really have the opportunity to grow anything. I do have a small houseplant by my window, if that counts. "
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","friend_value","Getting to know each other from every angle possible and being there for one another is probably what I value most in a friendship. Friendship is all about trust and sacrifice. I enjoy being able to get to know everything about the other person, and being able to be there for them. I also appreciate the fact knowing that there is somebody who has got my back and is there for me as well!"
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","like_work","I am an accountant for a small health clinic. I consider myself to be an introvert, so being able to work by myself is definitely what I like most about my job. I also like the fact that my job is rather routine and rarely are there any emergencies or surprises.  "
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","strangest","I grew up in a really small town, so there were a lot of strange things. I would have to say that the strangest thing was how nobody really had any privacy. Everybody knew everybody and was always in your business. I would always find it strange how quickly rumors would spread around town like wildfire. "
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","why_studies","I do these online studies as a way to supplement my income. I appreciate the fact that I can pay some of my bills by spending some time doing online studies. It's a win-win situation because I get to pay some of my debts, while helping out in the academic field as well. "
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","cute_baby","A close cousin of mine has twin girls. The other day while I was visiting at their home, I was playing with the girls. Whenever they would laugh, they would grab each other and hug while they burst out laughing. This is probably the cutest thing I've seen kids do--it was just so adorable!"
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","religious","I am really not a religious person. Growing up, my family never went to church or really participated in any kind of religious practices. Religion has just never really been a part of my life at all."
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","fire_rescue","I would probably save my photo album. Everything else can be replaced, but its impossible to replace my photos. I would be heartbroken knowing that all my photos were gone forever, so I would most likely grab my photo album before they were destroyed."
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","mind_body","I would definitely choose to retain the mind of a 30 year old. What's the point of looking good if you're not going to be there mentally? I'd rather be white haired wrinkly, and smart, over looking youthful and having Alzheimer's. That's an easy choice for me!"
"R_3NWoLPlP5HnHUov","famous","I honestly wouldn't want to be a famous person. I think it would horrible for people to always know who you are. I feel as though you wouldn't have any privacy and it would become pretty annoying overtime. I appreciate being able to walk out in public without everybody knowing who I am, and I'm good with that!"
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","religious","I am not a religious person. I feel like may be there is a higher power but until there's definitive proof I will still be undecided. I just don't ever see me being religious and I don't think my mind can be changed."
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","friend_value","I value trust above all. If you can't be truthful I feel like there would never be a good relationship. I like someone who is open and honest and doesn't hold back. I truly value those friendships. "
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","cute_baby","When my daughter was first born she would constantly smile in her sleep. When I would hold her and rub her face she would always get the biggest smile. I cannot get that image out of my head, it was too precious. "
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","famous","I would like to be famous because that would give me a higher platform to help people. I would have the extra funds to help those in need. I wouldn't mind the fame as long as something good comes out of it."
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","why_studies","I do the online studies to share my opinion as well as make some money on the side. I like to do the studies because I feel like what I am doing is important to the researchers. I don't mind it at all. "
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","fire_rescue","I would save the cremated remains of my father. We never had a really close relationship until about a week before he passed. I would love to have him safe and with me."
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","strangest","Where I grew up, particularly the street there was always something going on. Whether it be a neighborhood spat or a block BBQ everyone was always outside doing something. It's rare to have a neighborhood like that nowadays. "
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","last_sing","I last sung to my daughter before I put her to bed. After her bedtime story we always sing ""You are my sunshine"" before she goes to bed. I feel like we really bond over that."
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","how_raised","I feel like I wish I was raised by both parents. My mother was a single mom so I think having another parent around would have been easier on her. Looking back though, she did an amazing job."
"R_3NX5ybVqpwd52qA","mind_body","I think I would want the body of a 30 year old. I would love to be able to be up and active and not let that slow me down. i feel like having a younger body would benefit me more."

"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","mind_body","I would want the mind of a 30 year old. What good is a nice body if you're senile? We value aesthetics too much, and who says your body has to look horrible?"
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","last_sing","I usually sing around the house as I do chores and housework. I'm almost always humming something, especially in the shower! Last I sang for someone else I performed at a church."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","friend_value","I value honesty. Don't lie to my face or speak about me behind my back. I just want people to be real with me so I can speak with them and know that I can trust them as I tell them secrets."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","religious","I am a religious person. God has presented Himself in multiple ways to me both in opportunity and salvations. I feel His presence often and believe that if I let that faith waiver I will lose this notion completely and it has come in very handy. I am not so quick to discount the supernatural."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","why_studies","I need the money. Let's just be flat honest, I'm doing these for income. I don't give to any ""charities"" because I need the money to survive. I ""take money from other Turkers"" because I need the money. I hate being guilted into doing things just because a study says so but I understand why they do it. I have found some very interesting surveys before and on other platforms I have been allowed to test products and send reviews which has been interesting as well."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","garden","I have a garden full of roses and flowers and they are super colorful. I have jasmine hanging off the front gate which leaves a wonderful scent. I intend to make a vegetable garden soon full of corn and potatoes. I want to move to a house with a bigger yard first though."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","cute_baby","I saw a child cuddling a cat on the swing. The cat looked so cute and the child was whispering to it and giggling. The cat seemed very content."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","famous","I would not like to be famous. I am incredibly introverted and hate being the center of attention. I try to divert all attention away from me and hate being in places where I have to stand in front of people and speak."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","fire_rescue","I would save my prized rock collection. I have many gemstones from all over the world and it would be very sad to lose them all. I have over one hundred stones from five years of collecting and it'd be very hard to get them back."
"R_3oGSlc0PgGyFY4l","how_raised","I would have liked to be less sheltered. I found out about a lot of things very late and was made fun of for it. I believed in Santa until I was 14 years old and was mocked in middle school for it and I felt awful."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that some of the houses have been torn down and replaced with mini-mansions. It is so very odd to see the original homes right next door to a huge mansion. The houses on the street used to be the same. You could go into any one and know the exact layout. Now, it looks fractured and uneven."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","garden","I always plant tomatoes every year. I love Jersey tomatoes and they just taste the best to me. I love to pick one, warm from the garden and eat it in a salad or with just a little salt and olive oil. It is like eating sunshine!"
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","fire_rescue","I would save my guitar. My guitar is a precious possession that is almost like a friend to me. It comforts me to play it when I sad and brings me joy when I am glad. It would be very difficult to replace this particular left handed model. My electronic devices could all be replaced and my photos are in the cloud. My guitar would need to be saved."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","why_studies","I do these studies because I hope to earn some extra money. I also find them fascinating. I get a special thrill when one of the studies is from Penn State or Rutgers because those are the schools I attended. I think that it is an amazing thing that I can also add to someone's research from the comfort of my home."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","how_raised","I can't think of anything I would change about the way I was raised. I think my parents gave me the love I needed to feel secure and the independence I needed to be confident in my own abilities. I think that they never doubted me and that they were supportive without being overbearing. "
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","religious","I do not consider myself to be a religious person. I think I am a spiritual person. Most religions, in my opinion, get very distorted by the humans who run the framework of the religion. The basic spirituality and value gets lost in rules and regulations."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","cute_baby","My students do cute things all the time! The cutest was when I went to one classroom and one of the students said to me ""You look just like the library teacher!"" It surprised him to see me out of the library!"
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","mind_body","I would want to have the body of a 30-year-old. My mind has only become better with age, so I expect that it will continue to do so. If my body is young, I can do the things that keep my mind sharp."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","famous","I would not like to be famous. I think that fame comes with too many problems. I would not like people to know everything about me because I am a very private person. I much prefer a simple life with my family and friends."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is humor. When you can laugh about life with a friend, then you can face anything that life throws at you. Sharing laughter with a friend lifts you above the worries and cares of life to a high plane."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","last_sing","I last sang to myself after watching an episode of Vikings on TV. As I got ready for bed, I was singing the theme song, ""If I Had a Heart"". It's by Fever ray and I find it very intriguing and soulful. It's just one of those melodies that resonates with me."
"R_3OitlTt3UjOKC8N","like_work","I am a school librarian. I love everything about it. I love reading stories to my students to share great children's literature with them. I love showing them how a library offers them a place to be a lifelong learner. I also love having the summer off. "

"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","fire_rescue","Assuming that I have my glasses and wallet on me I think I would carry out my PC.  I think the hard drives are sensitive to high temperatures and would be erased.  I've spent a lot of time making notes, archiving files, and even keeping a diary, all of which are in my PC."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","cute_baby","My niece once toddled over to me with a half-eaten cucumber and offered it to me.  It was slobbery but it was such a sweet and generous gesture that I had to accept it.  And eat it.  It wasn't delicious but I still smile at the memory."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","famous","No I wouldn't.  I know that sounds odd but I wouldn't like all the attention.  I wouldn't think the perks of fame would be fair should I receive them.  And I would always be afraid of disappointing any fans.  I also have this weird need to be liked, and the more famous I was the more opportunities there would be for judgment."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","strangest","When I hear about the childhoods of others I think about how good and safe I had it growing up.  Our town only had a wannabe gang who's biggest crime seemed to be the occasional tag of graffiti.  I never feared walking anywhere as a child and I naively assumed that others were feeling the same way."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","last_sing","I'm too embarrassed to sing to anyone else.  I don't even sing to myself normally.  The last time was just a continuation of an ear-worm of a song that got stuck in my head."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","garden","I don't.  I live in an apartment building and there's no communal garden.  There's a bit of green space around and I confess to once secretly planting a bit of ivy that got too big for the indoors but it got torn out."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","mind_body","I'd like the mind of a 30-year-old.  I could accept any physical infirmity but the idea of senility or dementia scares me.  My mother sometimes forgets things and it seems like her personality and decision-making ability has changed a bit.  I still love her but I wish she was as sharp as she was when she was younger."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","religious","No I'm not.  I wasn't raised in a devout household so I don't associate religion with nostalgia.  As an adult I value honesty and rationality and I can't really believe in anything so irrational as religion.  I'm glad that it can make others happy and virtuous but it's not something for me."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","why_studies","I can use the money.  It's also a form of work that I can do from home at anytime.  Finally there's much less stress than in a traditional job.  For one thing I didn't have to go through an interview and application process."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","friend_value","I think I value kindness most in a friendship.  If I think the other person is truly kind then I can forgive them any differences of mistakes and I can assume that they will do likewise of me.  Kindness brings people closer together and it leads to other qualities like tolerance, openness, honesty and loyalty."
"R_3oTruKfDwgTF7Px","how_raised","I wish my father showed more interest and were more involved.  He was old-fashioned and distant, but I could compare him to the fathers of my friends and how they interacted with them.  I wonder how my personality would have been affected and what kind of person I would be today had my father acted differently."
"R_3oYmyrABcvtlJyr","strangest","The strangest thing is that no one really talks to each other. People think you're weird if you're nice. That should be a norm. "

"R_3P7iDvVsVvc59Qv","religious","No. I think organized religion is weird and crock of crap. It makes people develop hatred for other groups. I think religion should be between you and your creator and their is no need to get together in a big group and pay money and sing songs to do that."

"R_3P7iDvVsVvc59Qv","famous","I wouldn't. It is such an invasion of privacy for those people. Even with all the money they make or the nice things they can have, they sacrifice their privacy and ability to live a simple life. I much prefer having a simple life."

"R_3PTW1aInk1J0Lh3","strangest","I wouldn't say there's much of anything strange about where I grew up. It was a pretty typical community in a major city. Though, that city is sprawling and so it felt like a suburb. The strangest thing, in a place full of ordinary things, might be that I ended up moving away from my childhood home and then moving down the street from that home years later."

You wouldn't be able to have any peace, like celebrities. I'd rather just be rather well-known within my industry such that it is commensurate to my level of ability. So, maybe just famous in my industry."
"R_3PTW1aInk1J0Lh3","how_raised","I really needed more self-discipline while growing up. It has created a lot of struggle for me through adolescence and now in adulthood. I should have been raised in such a manner such that I would not procrastinate as much as I do."

Just about everything I'm interested in life requires complex thinking. An old mind is not suited for such abstraction and complexity."

When you have loyalty, you know that person is going to stick with you through good and bad.

When you have integrity, you know that you'll get truthful answers and opinions for each other when it matters."

"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","how_raised","I think the fact of my parents yelling at each other all the time would be nice if it were changed.  Everything else I think has shaped me into the person I am today.  I enjoyed growing up in the different places that I have been to and wouldn't change that at all if the choice were there."
"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","fire_rescue","Nothing.  It's not worth the effort saving something that you don't take with you when you die anyway.  I wouldn't take anything."
"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","famous","I don't know if I want to be famous or not. It comes as a double edged sword in most instances.  I would like to be known for generosity and kindness, but not in the way a celebrity has fame.  It would be more towards a local area, and not necessarily world-wide or something like that."
"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","cute_baby","I'm not sure.  I don't have any kids of my own, and I don't interact with babies and children much.  "
"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","mind_body","The body.  You can always learn new things with your mind if you're up to it.  A body's elasticity deteriorates as we age and we can't get that back.  So, I would choose having a 30 year old's body."
"R_3PzuuyFOGB9NKOU","strangest","The lack of police intervention.  It gave us a lot of freedom to explore and imagine as kids should do.  I think the USA has gotten out of control of being so restrictive on everything and the brutal tactics of the police force is just uncalled for."

It's easy work that can be completed at home and the type of work is always new and interesting each day I log in. I once took a survey that asked me to judge the morality of different scenarios. That was a doozy. Some of the scenarios were way out there."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","how_raised","That's a tough question. I'm happy with the person I've become so I'm not sure if I'd change anything in any drastic way. I suppose I would've liked to learn more from my dad about cars. It would've been nice to learn how to do simple things like oil changes or the basics of how engines work. I guess its not too late to ask him!"
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","friend_value","I don't even know. Some of my best friends have been people who have a similar sense of humor as my own. I value people who are open-minded. I think that with the way things are going these days, its harder and harder to find people who are open minded."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","garden","We have a small garden but this time of year it isn't producing anything. Typically, we'll grow jalapeños, habaneros, and tomatoes. When I lived out on the northwest coast, I grew more leafy greens as they were easier to grow out there than hot peppers."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","strangest","There really isn't anything strange about where I grew up. At least, there's nothing strange that I'm aware of. There was an old asylum near my house that was demolished when I was little. My parents tell stories about running around in the abandoned building when they were young and I remember them talking about the chains hanging from the walls in the basement. Spooky stuff."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","religious","I'm not a religious person. However, I don't have any problems with religious people. I have had several religious friends and I love talking to them about religion and their views of the world. I see the value and benefit that religion can bring to people's lives but I guess I just can't see myself as a true believer of any of the major religions."

Yeah, I suppose I wouldn't want to be famous for the wealth or notoriety but if it comes along with creating something great so be it."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","mind_body","Having seen the potential ravages of old age on the human body, I'd probably choose to keep the body of a 30-year-old. I suppose it depends on whether that answer means I would not mature or grow in my thinking or if it means something else. I'm not sure how happy I'd be effectively stunted in mental growth in that way."

"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","cute_baby","My nephew is about 2 years old. He is just such a sweet little guy. I'm trying to think. No one situation or action comes to mind but whenever he's around I'm always taken aback as to how tender hearted and thoughtful someone his age can be."
"R_3qe2XbDIVkAwtjg","fire_rescue","I actually experienced a house fire about six years ago in which I lost literally every possession I owned. I woke up in the middle of the night and had to jump out my second floor window wrapped in a blanket in order to escape. Looking around now, I can't think of any one item that has long term sentimental value (as most everything sentimental already burned). There's actually a box of letters in the other room. I'd grab that."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is someone I can trust.  Someone who is loyal and doesn't betray me for their own benefit.  For someone that defends me to others instead of saying things for attention."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","strangest","I guess the strangest thing is that  I grew up in about 5 or 6 different places.  I can't think of anything especially weird otherwise.  They were all great places from what I can remember, though maybe idealized."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","mind_body","Wow this is a tough question.  My body already acts like I'm 90, so assuming it's not just meaning the looks of a 30 yr old, it's tempting.  But as my mother had early Alzheimer's and my grandmother did also, and it was awful to watch, that would be important too.  I suppose the latter, as a great mobile body with no mind behind it would be more useless."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","fire_rescue","I think the one thing I would save that would be irreplaceable otherwise would be my box of pictures.  These were from before digital cameras.  I don't think anyone else has any pictures of this time of my kids really."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","last_sing","The last time I sang to someone is singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner.  I sang this out loud to my girls.  I don't know why I pick this song but it is just to be weird I guess."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","religious","I am a religious person though I need to do better in this way.  The reason why is that the world makes sense when my beliefs explain it.  Life makes no sense otherwise, and no reason to do anything."
"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","how_raised","If I could have changed anything about the way I was raised I would have felt more accepted.  I wouldn't have been blamed for issues my mom had.  I wouldn't have been so constantly criticized and ridiculed."

"R_3qEykxuaONQngem","cute_baby","This is a tough question as I have had six children myself, and have had seen so many babies besides.  So I will try and think of anything that comes to mind.  I think the cutest thing is when babies just start laughing out of the blue about some movement or action that had no intention of making them laugh.  Such as a nephew that laughed so hard when one of my kids raised their hand.  For some reason they thought this was hilarious. "

If it were just for that, though, I'd have stopped long ago. I do them because I frequently learn new things about myself. Also, they help me keep an ear to the ground about what's currently happening in the academic world.

It didn't move, but she could spin around in it, playing with toys at different stations. She went around in a circle four times, excited the entire time, then promptly passed out while basically standing up. The newness was just too much for her little mind. It is a very cute memory."

I'd want to be known for genuinely helping people and changing lives for the better."

A few closets had an extra step deep in the back, and looking back they were probably there for shoes. To me then, though, they were mysterious, and I routinely searched for levers or panels that would help me open the secret door."

I see trust as something that has to be earned and maintained on both sides. Once trust is damaged the relationship is likely to break down. I would say that communication is a close second, in some ways it could even been seen as one aspect of trust because you have to trust someone in order to be able to open up to them."

It just seems like such an absurd concept to me. I view most religions as a means of control and a crutch for weak minded people. I completely support freedom of religion though, these are just my own personal beliefs."

As vain as it sounds, I have a body that some people would kill for. I've already had my feel of having an incredible body, so I wouldn't be missing out on anything. At 60 I'll still look better than most people far younger than me...besides there is FAR more to life than just looking good. Aging is a natural part of life, I wouldn't want to be deprived of that."

I find being around people frustrating and exhausting most of the time, so being famous would be a real strain. That said, if I had to have any kind of fame, I'd like for it to have something to do with the arts. Ideally, writing or art, and I wouldn't actually become famous until after I had passed away."

One good thing about the job is that I'm on my feet all day long, I get plenty of exercise so I don't have to bother with doing any cardio.

"R_3rPrfVFC63j8r4K","last_sing","I was singing ""killing in the name of"" to myself about 20 minutes ago while listening to a band called ""profits of rage"". I sing to myself quite often because I've usually got music going in the background whenever I'm not working...not much for tv. As far as singing to someone else, I guess it would've been last month at a friend's birthday party."
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","why_studies","At first, I did them when I needed surgery and was out of work. I did them for extra money. Now, I just do them for fun. It is easier when I can pick and chose the ones I want. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","religious","I am not a religious person. I grew up in a strict religious household, but as I got older, i just saw how silly it all was. Sure, religions have done some good in the world, but they have done a lot more harm. And they continue to do harm in the name of a loving deity. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","strangest","There were a lot of strange things about it. Not ""Stranger Things"" strange, but just unusual. Looking back, the racial diversity of my neighborhood was the strangest. It was like a TV show created with the right balance of all ethnicities. I didn't realize how unusual this was until i got older and lived other places. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","garden","No, I don't have any. I live in an apartment, so it would be tough to have anything growing in there. I do wish I had space for a garden. I would love to grow pepper plants. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","famous","I would like to be famous mainly because I like to entertain people, to make them happy. Plus, I would get to have more money. That is a good benefit!"
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","mind_body","This is a very tough question, but I would have to go with ""mind"" rather than body. i would want to keep my thinking sharp. I think it is much more important that my body. keep in mind, that I would keep my aging body in the best shape I could. It may not be the body of a 30 year old, but I would do the best I could. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","fire_rescue","I have a small safe under my bed. It doesn't contain anything of monetary value, but it has a lot of keepsakes and things that mean a lot to me, personally. I would try to grab that next, if I could. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","how_raised","I think I was raised to be cautious and not take chances. If I could change anything, I think it would be that. I would like to have been taught to take chances -not stupid chances like jumping into traffic -but other types of chances - like starting a business. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","friend_value","Definitely loyalty is the thing I value the most on a friendship! I want a person for a friend who is what they seem. But more important than that, a person who is loyal and wouldn't  betray you. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","last_sing","Well, I have never really sang to anyone else. The last time I sang to myself was in the car, this morning, driving to work. I think that is pretty common. Never to anyone else, though. Unless you could bad karaoke. In that case, it was about 10 years ago. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","like_work","I am an analyst. This is about as exciting as it sounds. That's okay, though. I am getting older, and I like the stability of the job, plus it doesn't wear me down, like some of my past jobs did. "
"R_3RsGvFJ9x4Yd7Xw","cute_baby","I have children, so I have seen lots of cute things. One of the things I like the best is how excited and happy little kids or babies get. When my older daughter was very little, she used to get so excited when she got a present, her whole body would shake. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","cute_baby","The cutest thing is when my daughter was 3 years old. She had just learned the song the itsy, bitsy spider, and she loved singing it everyday. One day she was singing it with her face close to the floor. Then she said,"" look mommy the itsy, bitsy spider."" I looked down and realized she was singing the song to an actual spider crawling on the floor. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","fire_rescue","I would save my computer because it has so much personal information on it. As well as photos, songs, books and many things that would take me money and time to replace. And it has family information on it that I want to save, like my uncle's obituary. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","last_sing","Today was the last time I sung to myself. And I sung to my daughter this morning. Singing songs is something we both love to do, even though we aren't that good at it. We make up songs and sing it to each other. We change words to popular songs, and sing them together. But we have a good morning song that I sing to her when she wakes up. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","why_studies","There's a couple of reasons why I do online studies. One is because I'm the weird person that enjoys doing surveys, it's fun for me. Two is because I get paid money for doing surveys, instead of points or stickers. Before finding Mturk I was completing surveys for points or the opportunity to earn money. Three is because its a practical way to fill my free time. It's much better than sitting on the couch watching television.  "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","strangest","The strangest thing was the cemetery behind my house. It was a couple of feet from my backdoor. Having a real cemetery in my backyard was fantastic during Halloween. My house was always the scariest. And it never bothered me because I wasn't scared of graves or ghosts. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","mind_body","That's a great question. I want the mind of a 30 year old for the last 60 years. Dementia runs in my family, so losing my memories is my greatest fear right now. I've been doing everything I can to prevent it from happening to me. So being able to have the mind of a 30 year old alleviates all of my worries. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","like_work","I'm a project manager for a large company. Basically I manage employees as they work on projects, and make sure clients are satisfied. I love the freedom my position gives me, I get to choose everything except for the deadline. I choose the projects I want to work on, the people I want on my team, how much client interaction I want to have and how the work is handled. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","how_raised","I would change the way I was socialized in my early years. I was discouraged from forming close bonds to kids and adults. And I could not do things like have sleepovers or visit people's houses. I was raised to keep my distance from people. As an adult people think I;m kind of cold, and I know that played a huge part in my personality. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","garden","Yes, I have an apple tree in my back yard and there is a pecan tree in my front yard. I don't have a garden now,but I do want to plant one next summer. And I don't have any plants in my yard, just grass. My neighbors pick apples off my tree all summer long. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","famous","No I would not like to be famous. Being famous comes with too much scrutiny, and some of my fans would be unbalanced. I could not imagine people knowing everything I do, or people feeling they were entitled to know everything about my life. I'm much too private for that. The only good thing about being famous is the money. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","friend_value","I value loyalty more than anything else in my friendships. When friends are loyal they are supportive even when i'm wrong. That doesn't mean they tell me that I'm right, it means they can admit I was wrong while still uplifting me. In difficult situations loyal friends always have my back, they always stand up for me. "
"R_3sn6ugfhL18sHEH","religious","Yes, I'm a very religious person. I'm religious because I completely believe in the existence of God. There is no way this world came together randomly without the help of God. Everything works together perfectly, from the cells in our bodies to the weather to the solar system. The proof of God existing is in everything we see. And since I know God exists I want to thank him and praise him for my existence. And God doesn't ask much from me. Humans have more rules than God does. So if I can follow the thousands of rules humans have, I can follow the few that God has given me. "
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","why_studies","I do these studies for a variety of reasons.  Some of the studies are interesting, and I like to try to figure out what they're trying to study.  The main reason I do them, however, is for extra spending money and to have a constructive way to spend free time at home."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","like_work","I work as a business analyst.  I like to work with numbers, and find ways to meaningfully represent data in textual and visual formats.  I really enjoy trying to make a difference in people's lives (indirectly), and to affect the business's bottom line."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","how_raised","I wish that we had had more money growing up.  Not necessarily for my sake, however.  My brother and I were well cared for.  More for my parents' sake.  I know that money was a cause of stress, and that they weren't able to do as many things as they would have liked to in their younger years."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","garden","We have a small garden in our backyard.  I planted some hazelnut bushes on my folks' farm, but they haven't produced nuts yet.  There is also a larger garden out on the farm, so we only grow herbs and vegetables that we cook on a regular basis.  There are a few fruit trees on the farm, but they are not very big yet.  The pear tree produced quite a bit of fruit for the first time this year."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","friend_value","I value trust, respect, and loyalty the most in a friendship.  I have had friends with values closer to mine over the years, but most of them have faded as distance grows.  I have one friend that has quite different values than I do, but we've just been there for each other for the past 30 years.  We always treat each other with respect, and vary in the amount of time we spend together, but we've been friends this whole time and have a great deal of trust in each other."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","mind_body","I would want to maintain the body of a 30-year-old.  I know lots of older people that are still extremely sharp, and haven't changed much from their 30s.  The body is the limiting factor for them, and the body can also have some mental effects as people become more dormant."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","cute_baby","I didn't see this in person, but happened upon a video once online.  A baby smacked one of those little inflatable punching bags, and giggled when he hit it.  Then the punching bag popped back up and knocked the baby off balance.  It was hilarious."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","strangest","The current environment is completely different than when I was growing up, so I would say that's the ""strangest"" thing about my home town.  I went to a single school for 13 years straight.  Now they have four elementary schools, and are building another!"
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","famous","I don't think that I'd like to be famous.  I'm a very private person, and don't care for the attention that would come with being a celebrity.  While it would be good to use the position for some positive societal influences, I just don't think that I'd like to be that visible."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","last_sing","I was singing in the shower just a couple of days ago.  While I won't bore you with the song details, I do this on a regular basis when I think nobody can hear. I used to participate in choirs, but haven't done that in many years."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","fire_rescue","I would save my wife's computer.  It contains many memories for her over the years, and has a lot of tweaking that's been done to it to help her with her photography hobby.  This would also give us a means of communicating with other people electronically right away."
"R_3szF91G2yxOJF7Y","religious","I believe myself to be a religious person, even though I don't make it to church very often.  I would probably apply the ""born again"" label to myself, although it seems somewhat cheesy.  I had some great friends in college that helped me discover my faith, and I stay in contact with most of them.  I'm thankful for those years and my faith, because it's provided a strong foundation for my family."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","famous","I'm really not into the fame thing but if I was, I suppose I'd like to be jnow for a scientific achievement or maybe a piece of art. Being famous was really never a fantasy of mine but I could probably think of a few cases where I'd find it fun."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","cute_baby","The most hilarious thing I ever saw was a video on youtube that had a child in a stroller turn around with this totally hysterical shocked look on his face. It was almost cartoonish the way he shook his head and had his eyes wide open. I wish I could find it again."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","like_work","Right now I am semi-retired but most of my life was spent doing IT work. Everything from network administration to customer support. I'm a little too old to do that now but I'd be glad to go back to work if someone would hire me. "
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","friend_value","Probably loyalty. There is nothing that can matter more to a friendship than loyalty. I suppose love would be in there somewhere but that's not a necessity. My friends should know that I'll do anything I can if they need help and I know the same."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","fire_rescue","My computer. Definitely, my computer. Everything is on it. My whole life for the past 25 years. There is nothing else that would be as important since all my data and photos are on it. I have no sentimental items that I can think of. "
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","strangest","The strangest thing about my childhood neighborhood was that it appeared completely normal. It was a typical Catholic/Irish suburban neighborhood and and everything looked normal on the outside. It was the mid 60's though and much took place behind closed doors that we never talked about."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","why_studies","There is no easy answer to that but off hand I'd say for both money and a productive use of time. I'm disabled and in front of the computer most of the time anyway so it only makes sense to use that time to make some money. Sometimes the work is interesting but usually not. "
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","mind_body","I would definitely go with the 30-year-old mind. I would much rather be able to think than be able to do somersaults or run a marathon.  Being mentally sharp is more important than anything, at least it is to me."
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","how_raised","I suppose I wish that my parents were a little more strict about school and that they did not get divorced. It was not a real dysfunctional household but could have been a little better. I did not have much discipline until I finally went into the Navy in 1982. "
"R_3VFpEa12jO9mfE5","religious","I am not. I am an atheist and have been since I left Catholic school. I believe in science, data, facts and rational analysis. There is no place for religion in my life, it is based on mythology, not science."

"R_3xbgRCIHUBN2nBv","how_raised","i would want my step dad out of the picture. he was a very negative part of my childhood, not anything serious but he never asked politely fir things. Never hugged me or said he loved me. He was like a little boy who had a crush on a girl and would show it by calling her names and teasing her."
"R_3xbgRCIHUBN2nBv","famous","No, I don't like to be the center of attention, at least not all of the time. I want true friends, not ones after my fame. plus i'm an introvert and can't always be on all the time"

"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby or child do was a video I saw on social media the other day. This baby was cuddled up with their mother in the bed and the mother was going on how her baby is clingy and doesn't want her to leave, the facial expression the baby made at their mom and the camera was priceless."
"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","mind_body","I would prefer to be able to live to the age of 90, because you can't be young forever and I like to live life simple, so being old won't really bother me as long as i can still watch TV and eat food I will be more than satisfied, I enjoy the little things."
"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","why_studies","I do these online studies to kill time and also provide myself with a secondary income which can help me pay more of my bills and even save a little money on the side to invest or use for shopping and others little things extra cash comes in hand for."

"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the way the neighborhood was designed. It was like driving in a circle, but you will always have to leave from the way you came in, people would always get confused when coming in and out of there."
"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden. I am interested in starting one, my and one of my friends spoke about doing this a couple of times before. Do you have any tips or advice on how to get started?"
"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","religious","I would day that I am in some way religious, because I was raised to have religious beliefs from my family members, but after the years of becoming an adult and growing into my own self, it slightly faded. So I would say I'm somewhat agnostic at the moment."
"R_4NR1kTFfVby2NcR","famous","I actually don't want to be famous, I have no desire to be famous in any way, because fame comes with a price. You lose all privacy and can't do simple things like you use to before. People start to assume that you're rich and try their best to get over on you."

"R_5o2DRbAkhpu9tFT","why_studies","I do these studies to make money. I started years ago when I made less money and relied on this for life. Now, I use it more for extra money."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","fire_rescue","My computer laptop. It has a lot of things in there from my past, 10+ years ago. Lots of memories there. I would try to save it if I can."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is how sheltered it is. The area is mostly Asians and before college, I was never really exposed to any other race. Once I got to college, it was a bit of a culture shock to see all different kinds of people."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","religious","No, I was never raised as a religious person. My parents are Buddhist but they never practiced it. My fiance is Christian, but she doesn't try to convert me. I just believe in what I've always believed in, and haven't tried to change."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","garden","No I don't. I prefer to buy all my fruits and vegetables from the grocery store. Also, it would be difficult to maintain. I have no interested in a garden."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","last_sing","The last time I sung to myself was in my car listening to the radio this morning. It is always therapeutic to me. I don't sing to anyone else except for karaoke. I haven't been karaoke in about a year."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","friend_value","Friendship is only worth it if you have friends that care. Many people have LOTS of friends. But the ones that are most valuable are the ones that will be there for you when things are tough. Everyone will be there for you when things are good, but when you aren't having a good day, you want someone to talk to."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","famous","I always wanted to be famous. As a younger kid, I always watched American Idol and wished that was me. I would've wanted to be a professional athlete but I didn't have the skills for that. It would be nice to not have to worry about money at all."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","like_work","I work in Finance. I like the flexibility of my schedule and that I get to work from home. Also, I get paid a decent salary so that's a good perk. Obviously not enough since I'm on mTurk! It is also fun to engage with my coworkers."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","why_studies","I do these online studies to help others with their research. But at the same time, it is good side income, to be honest. However, I find a lot of them to be very interesting and I take them seriously."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","mind_body","I would want the mind. The reason for this is because as you age, you lose memory and you are not as wise as you once was. People may judge you because of that. If you're 90, people will expect you to have a certain body type already."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","how_raised","One thing I would change is to be more independent. I felt like my family spoon fed me a little bit and once I started living on my own, I had to get adjusted to that lifestyle. For example, I never did my own laundry until after high school, and always have a hot dinner at my dinner table. I was a bit spoiled."
"R_5pbmYZjQYY3Cket","cute_baby","Babies and children are cute in general. I have three little nieces so I can definitely relate. The cutest thing is when they are playing with their toys, such as legos, and pretending to be an adult (ie driving a car, etc)."
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","fire_rescue","I would save laptop. This is because it has all of my personal information inside which I can easily access from any location that has wifi or any type of internet access. It'll be easier for me to look for a new place and all of the necessities again after our house has burned down. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","how_raised","If I could change anything, I think it would be if my dad was more present in my life. He was never in my life when I was growing up until he got involved once in a few years. In highschool was when we started to talk a bit more after he came out of nowhere. I love my dad, he's nice and cool, and although I do have a much bigger family from his side, I do wish he had focused more on me."
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","cute_baby","I think it would be when they look and smile at you without their parents knowing. Their innocence and cute, chubby faces are so cute and they're so curious about everything and everyone around them. I like when babies and children look at me and smile and wave and I do the same and they just giggle which catches their parents attention. It's so pure and adorable. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","friend_value","I value loyalty and honesty.. Getting friends as you grow older is much harder to come by. I would prefer to have  a friend that sticks with me through all the good and bad times we have together. Loyalty in a friendship is just as important as anything else because you know that they are really there for you and won't go behind your back. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","last_sing","I last sang to myself yesterday. I sing a lot, espeically when I'm alone in the house. I like doing it, it's fun. I can always pretend I'm a famous singer singing these songs in front of an audience without being in front of actual people and pretend I'm in a music video. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","famous","I wouldn't say I'd like to be celebrity famous, but more so in a way I'd like to be well known in a certain industry. With fame, there are so much consequences and dark side things that's going in. I would like to be famous because I'd like to be heard, I want people to know how creative I can be and have everyone see that. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","why_studies","I do these online studies because they are quite fun. I get to learn all the different types of studies business and universities conduct on different types of topics and I get to be part of them without leaving my house (which isn't a bad thing)."
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","religious","No, I am not a religious person. I never considered myself religious even though I use to go to church when I was younger. As I got older, I started to shy myself from religion, specifically christianity. I don't know why, but it just seem so hyprocritical and people put all of their faith and belief in a person that's does not exist. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","strangest","I always lived in this city. I think the strangest thing about where I was growing up was that I always lived near a cemetery or grave yard. I found this strange at first because I would always fear the dead would rise and take over the world or that I would see the spirits of the dead. After a while, I just got use to it and never thought about it too much. Now, I occassionally walk through the cemetery/grave yard just for peace and quite while walking my pets. "
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","mind_body","I would retain the mind of a 30 year old. That shows people even though I am old, I am still quite young and healthy and smart. I would rather have the knowledge of what I had gathered through the years of my young life into my old years that I can still use to this day in my old age. So, in case someone tries to prove me wrong, I can just show them how right I am."
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","garden","I have plants in my house. They were at first trees that started to grow bigger and bigger every time to the point where I had to cut them into smaller portions to have more room. It's like having a homemade jungle which I love. It's not really hard taking care of them."
"R_6AwqILSc3hAOrYd","like_work","Thanks for asking! I'm an accountant at this accounting firm. What I like about the job is the job benefits, the schedule, and my co-workers. I'm quite happy about this position because I had worked so hard to get an accounting position even with the amount of experience I have. "
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","strangest","The Barber Shop Quartet had their headquarters in my town.  They had a very large house on the lake.  I'm not sure how often they met.  I believe that the headquarters is not located here anymore."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","last_sing","I don't sing to myself or really sing at all.  So, I think it was probably when my grandchildren were younger.  I would sing some silly songs to them."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","cute_baby","I always thought it was cute when a baby looked at their hands in amazement.  It was as if they didn't know where they came from.  They would turn their hands in one direction and then another and contemplate what their hands were doing there."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","religious","In some ways I am.  I believe in God but I don't go to church.  I try to lead my life in a way that God would approve."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","how_raised","My father died when I was 13.  This changed my whole world.  My mother was caught up in grief but had to go on and continue to work.  I wish my father hadn't died at that time in my life.  I'm sure I would have been raised differently."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","fire_rescue","That's a good one.  I have many antiques which would obviously are not replaceable.  So, I would go back in a get my grandparent's mantle clock.  In this way, I would be saving a family heirloom also."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","garden","I actually have a garden.  My neighbor is nice enough to give me three rows in her garden.  I call it my gardening for dummies garden.  She always tills my rows and often even provides me with plants too.  Her father always enjoyed gardening and she has helped pass this love onto others."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","famous","I think it would be wonderful to be a famous author.  I would enjoy writing fictional stories and putting myself in the minds of my characters.  Even though I was famous, I don't think I would be swarmed by reports and could probably lead a somewhat normal life too."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","why_studies","For the most part, I do them to make extra money.  But, sometimes it also feels nice to use my brain for certain tasks.  It gives me a chance to try or do things that I normally wouldn't do."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","like_work","I worked in the Environmental field.  I always liked working with people on a project and trying to be as efficient as possible.  I also enjoyed trying to motivate people to reduce our manufacturing impact on the environment."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","mind_body","It would have to be the body of a 30-year-old.  If I had all the aches and pains of a 90 year old, I think I would be depressed.  If I could remain active, that would make me happy no matter what my state of mind."
"R_74FNkZVJV3Rx2DL","friend_value","I think it's the fact that you know someone will always be there.  Not necessarily to do something for you but just there to talk or do something as a companion.  It is always nice to be able to share common problems or remember funny times together."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","cute_baby","Babies do so many cute things it is very hard to choose just one thing. Every time I see a child smile or hear their laughter it just melts my heart. Also, watching their face light up during Christmas time is pretty magical."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","like_work","Right now I am doing any online work I can find. I cannot afford daycare for my children and we are still recovering from hurricane Irma. I'm also looking for any other work I can do offline to help my family, but that is difficult with my responsibilities regarding my children."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","mind_body","I would want to have the body of a 30 year old and retain all of my wisdom from my experiences. This would allow me to really enjoy the last years of my life. I would assume this would also keep me from getting dementia or something like that."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","why_studies","Right now I am turking full time because I lost my home and main job with hurricane Irma. Thankfully the hotel FEMA put us in has internet so I am able to use mturk. I also enjoy doing research studies and this type of work, so I am very thankful that the hurricane didn't take this from me too."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was in the shower. I enjoy that time because I can listen to music and just let myself go. No one judges you when you're in the shower."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","fire_rescue","Only if it was safe, I would run back in and get my safe. Even though it's fire proof, I wouldn't want to take any chances. It has all of our birth certificates, SSNs, and several irreplaceable keepsakes."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","friend_value","I value honest friendships the most. The truth is sometimes the most difficult thing to say. I admire those that can still speak the truth kindly to people they care about. "
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","garden","I do not have a garden currently because of my circumstances. However, I am hoping that when we get moved to a new place there will be room for me to grow a garden. I'm not very good with plants but I've always wanted to try to grow a garden."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","strangest","Where I grew up was a pretty normal suburb. There was a park I used to always go to nearby. Sometimes it was strange to see all the different things that people came up with to do outside."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","famous","I would not like to be famous. Famous people have too much drama in their lives. I also would not like to be surrounded by tons of people all the time because of my social anxiety."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","how_raised","I had a very nice childhood, so there is not very much that I would want to change. I do wish that I had pushed myself a little harder in school. I also wish that I would have been more involved in extracurricular activities and not so shy and anxious."
"R_7WH4vPTxWSZYRCp","religious","I am a very religious person, but I am shy about going to church. I have social anxiety so sometimes it can be hard for me to be around large groups of people. I was raised in a Christian family and my grandfather was a Deacon so religion is a very important part of my life."
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","how_raised","I'd have just like a more relaxed atmosphere. Everyone tended to have really strong personalities and depending on who got together, people could clash. So I would have liked for everyone around me to just be more relaxed and neutral in their view points. That would have been really nice I think. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","famous","I'd like to be famous in a creative way. I'd prefer for it to be something associated with making movies. It's something I am really interested in and think I could do well at. And I think it'd be a fun lifestyle to live. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","mind_body","I'd happily choose to have the body of a 30 year old until I am 90. Looks get you a lot farther in life, so I think you could use that to your advantage. Once you hit a certain age, people stop listening to you no matter how smart you are. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","friend_value","I value loyalty above everything else. I like knowing that a friend will be there if you ever need them. And I like knowing that I can confide in them without worrying about it. If they aren't loyal, none of their other good attributes matter. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","why_studies","I lost my job and started doing them until I found somewhere else to work. But I found that I enjoy basically making my own hours. And I can work as little or as much as I want. So for me it's just a freelance job. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","garden","No, I've never actually tried growing any plants or anything like that. I'm vegan so I love vegetables though. I've seen those indoor gardens where people use sun lamps and that seems really cool. So I'd give that a try at some point. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","like_work","I'm what is called a task worker. I do freelance jobs. I like being able to work when I want. The freedom really makes it easy to overlook any of the more negative aspects. And the ability to choose what types of jobs to do keeps it interesting. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","last_sing","I don't think I've ever sang to anyone else, except one time I did karaoke. I last sang to myself either in the car or the shower. I like to sing where no one else can hear me. It's fun but I don't have the best voice. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","cute_baby","I honestly can't think of anything. I don't really like kids. It'd be easier to name something cute that an animal did. So my mind is blank when trying to think of an answer. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","strangest","Probably this haunted park on the outskirts of town. Everyone has some ghost story about it and I find it really interesting. I've seen my own share of weird things there. But it has a really interesting backstory dating back about 100 years. It'd make for a good movie. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","religious","I am not religious. I do believe in a God. But I don't really follow a particular religion. I like just forming my own opinions as I continue to learn new things. That feels more organic to me. "
"R_87GSSywubfuqKM9","fire_rescue","I'd save my Playstation 4. I have a long history with Playstation and am very loyal. I'd hate to be without it. And it's valuable, so it'd be expensive to replace. "
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","religious","No, I'm not religious. I think religious, other than being a way for people to take your money and control you, are a way for people to condemn others and ignore their similarities. I think it divides people onto teams."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","how_raised","Well, my parents, especially my mother, were not too shy about beating me when I was little. It really messed me up. I'd probably choose to change that."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","friend_value","Compatibility. It's best to have someone you can enjoy a long silence with. Someone you don't feel need to talk to out of necessity, like we're doing now."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","cute_baby","I have no use for babies, cute or otherwise. They all look the same, despite what their bores of mothers think. All completely useless, and shitting and drooling on themselves. No thanks. And you can keep your baby pictures to yourself. Show me a picture of an adult who's done something interesting and I might care. "
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","like_work","I work for the cash, and that's it. I'm passionate about other things, that I do get paid for, but I don't consider it work. Work needs to be done, but passion, I'd be doing it anyway."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","garden","No. I used to garden, but the trouble is, everything blooms at once, so I have a couple weeks where I have a crazy amount of vegetables that mostly rot. After that it's back to the Wal-Mart every week for produce."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","fire_rescue","I'd get my wallet. It has all my stuff in it. I'd need to get a hotel for a while, and I wouldn't want to go through the hassle of getting new ID and credit cards, plus a new wallet."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","mind_body","I'd want the mind, probably. What good is a hot body if you're brain is rotting. Would you want to be attractive and suffer from dementia? "
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","famous","No. People love to tear down famous people for any human foible. If you're famous and you make the same mistake anyone else makes, you will be crucified, figuratively. If I had to be famous, it's be in the J.D Salinger way. The recluse that everyone respects but nobody knows anything about."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","why_studies","Some of the tasks are interesting. I like the convenience of making a few hundred a month without getting out of bed. so, laziness, I guess. It's a good supplement to my income, and I get to do it on my own terms, which is important tot me."
"R_8D2uyGXcPEqXxWV","strangest","There was a junkyard when I was a kid. My friend's family ran it. They kept goats instead of mean dogs. That was kind of strange."

"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","mind_body","I would have to go with retaining the body.  I've seen quite a few older people who still had all their mental faculties, but none of them could still get around comfortably.  Right now I'm closer to 30 than to 90 but I've already got so many aches and pains and it's getting more and more difficult to get around.  Even just getting a restful night's sleep is becoming a challenge."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","famous","I have always wanted to be a film director.  I love movies and being a director would be my dream job.  I would love to go to all the film festivals to promote my newest film and go to conventions to meet with fans.  I keep telling myself that I'll actually make the effort someday."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","garden","I have a small vegetable garden in my back yard.  I wanted to start a garden as a way to get some fresh air and exercise and decided to grow vegetables so I could save a little money on groceries at the same time.  It's really worked out well since there's nothing better than getting veggies that fresh."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","how_raised","The one thing I would change is that I wish my parents had stressed even more the value of preparing for the future.  They did tell me it was important and that I should make sure I save for emergencies and retirement, but I really wish they had driven it home more.  As I get older I realize what a mistake it was not to listen to what they were saying and I just wish that my parents had realized that I wasn't taking their advice seriously enough."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","like_work","I'm the shipping and receiving manager for an electrical supply company.  What I really like about it is that it is very structured.  When I go into work each day I know exactly what I need to do that day.  I don't really like surprises or uncertainty so this type of work suits me well."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","fire_rescue","It would have to be the picture of my parents that was taken right after they first met.  It's the one thing of theirs that I still have and it's irreplaceable.  While some of my other possessions are quite important to me, they can be replaced.  That picture means more to me than anything else I own."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","friend_value","It would be the same thing I value most in any relationship and that would be honesty.  If you know that you can always trust your friends then there is no difficulty or problem that you can't overcome.  It also helps to keep me out of trouble when my friends are honest enough to tell me when I'm about to do something incredibly stupid."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","last_sing","Last sing to myself?  That's easy:  in the shower this morning.  I always sing to myself in the shower, it's like it's part of my routine.  The last time I sang to someone else would be a few months ago to my girlfriend.  She was sitting on the couch reading and I just came in the room, sat down next to her and started singing.  I wasn't really trying to be serious or romantic, my voice is way too bad for that.  I just wanted to get a laugh out of her and it worked like a charm."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","why_studies","The main reason is for the income.  Money in your pocket is never a bad thing.  But some of these studies are genuinely interesting and really make you think.  There have been a few that after I completed them I had a genuine feeling that I had contributed something worthwhile and important.  But, mostly it's for the money."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","cute_baby","I remember this one time when my niece was about six months old.  She was crawling around on her blanket on the floor when my puppy walked up to her.  My puppy wasn't one of those wild and rambunctious types, he was quite calm and well behaved for a puppy.  Anyway, he walks up to my niece and they make eye-contact and just stare at each other for a moment, then my puppy licks her on the nose.  My niece started giggling like crazy and was rolling around on the blanket.  She then crawled up to the puppy and stuck her nose right in his face until he licked it again, then started the giggling and rolling around routine all over.  She kept this up for a good 10 minutes."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","religious","I am somewhat religious.  I do believe in a higher power and try to live my life according to what I learned in church when I was younger.  I'm religious because I can't, or maybe just don't want to believe that everything is just the result of random chance.  Religion also provides me with some comfort in believing that there is something more after this life."
"R_8joCQWTA1I8aLf3","strangest","Where I grew up is considered the most haunted area in the whole state.  My hometown has the most ghost sightings and reports of paranormal activity in all of Florida.  Everyone knew at least one person who swore that their house was haunted."

I think having the mind of an older person would be beneficial, as there is wisdom that comes with age. having the body of a 30 year old would allow me to do all the things i can do now, even in old age"
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","why_studies","I do them to pass time at work and earn some extra money for myself and my family. Bills really pile up when you have to 2 kids and a mortgage, so the extra $400-500 per month I can make while doing mturk helps out with some of the things we need to buy. I also find the surveys interesting and some of the tasks are fun. I also like to challenge myself to make as much money as i can each day or week or month."

If i had to pick one thing, I think I would say the first time she tried eating a pickle, her face scrunched up so much from the sour flavor that my wife and I both laughed for a long time afterward. It was definitely one of the cutest things I've ever seen."
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","how_raised","I would like it if my parents were more sensitive to me and my sister. we were always in daycare as kids, as both of my parents worked, and I think that a lot of the time we spent together was very superficial. Seeing how my wife's family is made me realize how close a family really can be, and I did not have that kind of closeness with mine."
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","last_sing","I sing to my daughter almost every night, so last night is my answer. She likes me to sing songs that she can dance to. I sing ""the wheels on the bus"" and ""If you're happy and you know it"" and she does the motions to the songs. "
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","religious","No I am not a religious person. I was forced to go to catholic school as a child and attend church weekly. After years of this, I decided that it was a bunch of nonsense, and I decided to not go to church or be religious at all."
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","strangest","On the street that I lived on, there was  body found in a small section of woods. The murder had taken place somewhere else, but whoever killed the person decided to try and hide the body in this area. My friends and I would often go over to that area and see if we could find ""clues"" although the murder happened years before that and the person was in prison already."
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","friend_value","I value honesty most in a friendship. I think it is important to be honest with people you associate with all the time, otherwise the whole relationship is a lie. There are times when the truth hurts, but i think that is necessary in a relationship because it shows that a true friendship can withstand brutal honestly."
"R_9vkboLU0AVVoe9X","fire_rescue","I would run back into the house and save my hard drive for my computer. It contains all of the pictures of my family and my children. It is the only place that all the pictures are together in one place, so I would save that."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","mind_body","I'd probably choose having the mind of a 30-year old. I will just find it easier to cope with old age if I still retain some of my mind agility that I currently have than having to suffer through memory loss that old folks have to deal with. Ultimately, I just tend to value the mind much more than the body."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","friend_value","I really value honesty and genuineness in a friendship. I can't stand fake interactions, or friendships with no substance. In those cases, I'd rather just be alone for the rest of my life. I also value intelligent conversations, and not just talks about menial and boring activities one does throughout the day. "
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","cute_baby","I don't find babies or children that cute. Although, I have to say that I sometimes find their innocence cute at times. Especially when they are trying to figure out something for the first time, and you can see their wide eyes trying to grasp what they're supposed to do. I find that hilarious!"
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","like_work","I'm a psychology researcher at my university. I work in a variety of projects including analyzing and summarizing data. I really like my job because it feels like I'm making a difference in the lives of people. Although, it can get a bit repetitive from time to time."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","fire_rescue","I don't think I have an item that I would go back to my burning house for. I really thought about this question, but I couldn't come up with an answer. Everything is temporary, and nothing material is worth getting your life in danger. At leas not for me it is."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","last_sing","I sing really often for myself. Of course while no one is watching. The last time I sang for someone else I was at the bar with my friends and were doing karaoke, and there was this song that I really liked. So I was given the microphone and started singing my heart out. According to my friends, I did not sing that bad. But who knows."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","famous","No, not really. I just don't see the point of having that much attention on me. I think I'd go mad just thinking about what I would do everyone trying to get my autograph, or stopping me on the street to take a picture. Eh, not for me."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","religious","I was raised catholic as a child. However, I quickly realized that religion was not for me. I just never appreciated the dogmatic and archaic approach that the church has. I was also not as invested in the belief of a deity, so I found myself constantly questioning and being bored during those times."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","how_raised","I guess I don't have much to say about this. I was raised quite well by my parents. If I had to choose, though, I'd say my parents should've pushed me to join some extracurricular activities after school. For example, learning the piano, martial arts etc."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","why_studies","I do them for a variety of reason. For one, I do it to help researchers like myself to get data about something important they're trying to solve. Another reason is to get additional income from Mturk on top of what I already do outside of the platform."
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","garden","No, I do not have a garden to begin with. I'd really love to, though. I just don't think I have the patience to maintain a garden which requires constant care and dedication. Just like many things in life. "
"R_b9KIEz7PcS2FV7z","strangest","I grew up in quite a normal neighborhood. I'd say too normal sometimes. Not much happened where I lived. It would be sort of scary at how peaceful and tranquil everything was. I sorta miss that nowadays."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","last_sing","I sang to myself in the car on the way home from work on Tuesday. My husband and I usually drive to work together, but he had an appointment and drove separately, so I rode alone and sang my heart out.  As for singing to others, I haven't done that since my boys were babies and couldn't make fun of my voice."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","famous","Yes, I'd love to be famous.  Probably only for a day though.  I would want to be a famous singer/songwriter. I don't actually have a creative or talented bone in my body, but that has still always been a daydream of mine."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","why_studies","I'll be honest and admit that initially I began completing studies for extra money. What I realized after doing several of them is how in depth they are and how important the research is.  These are not just studies to choose which headphones will sell best in the marketplace. They deal with social justice, equality, racism, sexism, I could go on and on. The work being done is critical and I'm honored to be a part of it."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","cute_baby","My sons have done many cute things, however, I saw a video on Facebook the other day that beats all.  It's a toddler who is in a store and his mother takes him to the Christmas decorations.  His reaction to all of the Christmas decor is absolutely precious."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","friend_value","Two things are essential to me in a friendship. The most important aspect of a friendship is honesty.  The second most important aspect of a friendship is trust.  Without these, I'm not able to maintain a relationship with anyone."

"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","fire_rescue","My photo album is the one item I would run in to save.  Pictures of my sons when they were first born and in the NICU can't be replaced.  I would be devastated to lose them."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the people. Everyone knew each other's business but no one ever got together to talk. The entire town did nothing but talk behind each other's backs and there was little truth to any of it because no one actually knew their neighbors. It was quite Twilight Zone'ish. I am not in contact with anyone at all from my home town, none of us talk at all."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","religious","Though I don't attend church regularly, I do consider myself religious.  I live by the values and teachings of my faith. I don't believe I have to go to a building once a week to prove I love and am loyal to God."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","garden","We just moved to our house a year and a half ago.  There have been so many improvements I've been working on inside the house, that I have not paid much attention to the outside.  We do not have any fruit trees at the moment.  We do have two boxwoods in the front of the house.  We don't have a garden. Our soil is very sandy and not ideal for one."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","how_raised","My childhood was quite dysfunctional, so there are many things I'd change about how I was raised. The most important thing I'd change is having a father. My father left and had nothing to do with me for most of my childhood.  I have always wanted a dad, so that is the one thing that I would change if I could."
"R_bD99GwqQUDFLu6J","mind_body","Without the mind, the body is not of much use.  I would choose to retain my mind. I feel a long life would be so much more rewarding with a sound mind."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","garden","The only things I have are house plants. I let my fiance take care of those because I tend to have the opposite of a green thumb. We live in an apartment so we cannot have any trees or a garden."

"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","famous","I really do not want to be famous. I do not want to feel the pressure of always being perfect and always being followed by paparazzi. I would like to be well-known for the good things I've done, but never famous."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","mind_body","I would definitely choose the body of a 30-year-old. If my body didn't cooperate with me, and I had the mind of a 30-year-old I might not be able to express myself and I might be in constant pain."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","religious","I am not a religious person. I feel like religion causes a lot of hate in the world and I do not want to be part of it. Even though I do not agree with religion, I still respect those that choose religion."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","how_raised","I would definitely change the way I was disciplined. I was raised by a single mother and she did not punish me and my brother. We were really naughty as teenagers because of the lack of discipline."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","strangest","There's not really anything strange about where I grew up. I grew up on the outskirts of a small town, and nothing really happens there. The neighborhood I grew up in was safe and quiet."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","cute_baby","I have 2 children. Their ages are four and one. The one year old is just starting to talk and I love to see my children interact and try to talk to each other. It is so sweet and makes me laugh every time."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","fire_rescue","I would grab my grandmother's ring. She gave me her ring a few months before she died. It is one of the only things I have from her. It is really the only thing of true sentiment that I have in my home."
"R_brQtCcuM3ua3SwN","friend_value","I like having a friend that will always be there for you no matter what. I value a lifelong friendship that can withstand all of life's milestones. You can not talk to this person for a while for whatever reason and they will still treat you like a great friend."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","last_sing","I never sing to someone else.  I do sing in the car if there is nobody around.  I love to do that.  I guess the last time would be driving to work this morning.  "
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","friend_value","I value my friends dearly, but the thing I value the most is honesty.  If I have a friend that is not honest with me, then why bother having them.  Honestly can be bad, because they might tell you things you don't want to hear, but in the long run, I would much prefer that honestly.  I can't stand when people are not truthful."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","mind_body","I would definitely want the mind.  It would be difficult not having the body, but I have known too many people with alzheimers, and that is such a sad disease.  I love learning things, and I can't imagine going through the day without being able to learn and take part in meaningful conversation with others."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","garden","In my yard, we have two pecan trees.  We also have a grape vine that does produce quite a few green grapes.  What I really like though, is my flower gardens.  I also have herbs in a few planters outside that I like to grow."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","strangest","I don't really think I grew up in a strange place, but I did grow up outside of the United States for a good part of my life.  I actually grew up in Canada until I was in high school.  I grew up in the western part near the Rocky Mountains, so I guess what would be strange, is I could go skiing after school any day I wanted in the winter.  It's not really strange, but it's different compared to where a lot of other people have grown up."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","why_studies","I do them for a couple of reasons.  I guess I initially got into them because my husband was in between jobs, and it was a great way to make a little extra income.  I've gotten to enjoy them.  I do them several times a day for a few minutes, and it makes me feel productive.  I also remember in college, when we had to do research, so I know it's helpful for others if I do them."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","fire_rescue","I probably would get our home computer, even though it is big a bulky.  We have everything on our computer.  We have financial information, personal information, but most importantly, we have lots of pictures.  Kind of makes me anxious to think about it.  I guess we should back it up more than we do so a zip drive would hold all of that.  That would be easier to get out of a burning house with just that in your hands."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","religious","I would say I am religious.  I am definitely a believer in God.  I pray every day, many times a day and I truly have faith in His existence and power.  To answer why, I would say that it is perhaps the way I was raised, but more importantly, doing the studying that I have done, I believe it to be true.  I have had too many things happen in my life to not believe it's real."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","how_raised","I was raised in an extremely strict home.  There are plenty of things I would change, but the first one that comes to mind, is I would have liked to have had a better relationship with my dad.  We are close now, but as a kid, the rule was to be seen and not heard.  We basically had not relationship, and I think I missed out on a lot because of that."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","cute_baby","There are so many things.  There are a lot of great videos on line right now.  I'm thinking of the one where the baby is laughing as her dad is ripping paper.  She thinks it's the funniest thing.  Puts me in a great mood every time I see it.  Nothing better then the sound of a baby laughing.  That used to be my ringtone."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","famous","I don't want to be famous in the way where people recognize me on the streets.  I think that would be awful.   I wouldn't mind being famous where people knew the name, but didn't really have a face for that name.  That would be in ways, such as being an artist or author.  I wouldn't like not being able to take part in life the way I do now.  Having people follow you or bother you would not be something I would like."
"R_BWnxUIISI0bzOgh","like_work","I'm an Educational Diagnostician.  Basically, I test kids for disabilities in the school system.  I do this with cognitive, academic and adaptive behaviors.  I also meet with parents, teacher, administrators and students to help design a good educational program for them in the public school.  I like it a lot because it is fast paced, so the time goes by very quickly.  I also like it because you see positive gains in the students, and it's good to feel that you were a part of that."
"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","famous","I would not want to be famous. I value my privacy tremendously. I am also very shy, reserved, and introverted so being in the spotlight sounds like a nightmare. "
"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","religious","I believe in God but I don't consider myself a religious person. I grew up in a Catholic household and went to Catholic school until I was 14 years old. I just didn't find religion to be important to me. I thought being a good person should be enough. "
"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","mind_body","I would choose the body of a 30-year-old because I want to be able to be physically active. I would want to be able to experience everything I can, which includes being physically capable. I want to travel, go sky diving, run a marathon, and so many other things."
"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","strangest","There really isn't anything strange about where I grew up. The house I lived in wasn't haunted or anything, there were never any robberies/burglaries in my neighborhood, and I didn't have any strange neighbors. It was actually a really good place to grow up. All the kids used to play and ride their bikes together, and the parents were all friends. "

"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","cute_baby","Well I might be bias, but when my nephew was a baby, I remember him wearing a cute beanie with animal ears on it and he was smiling. I was playing peek-a-boo with him, and he just kept laughing and laughing. He was also sitting in a high chair and drinking something. One time he laughed so hard that milk came out his nose. "

"R_bxRaJWk9dn4Hv8t","how_raised","I would change the fact that my parents were super strict with me so I wasn't really allowed to go out with friends. However, my parents let my brothers go out whenever they wanted. They were just more strict and protective of me because I was a girl. But because I wasn't allowed to do things, I acted out and rebelled a lot."

"R_Ck6l3DipaKN2bAJ","religious","I am a religious person in that I believe in God. However I don't really attend religious services that often. The reason I am religious is mostly because I was raised in a religious household. "

"R_d08VXyXm3CtH8E9","famous","Yes, I would enjoy that. Not because i want the attention, but because it would mean I did something noteworthy. To be famous means to be great, at at least one thing. I want respect from fame, not infamy."
"R_d08VXyXm3CtH8E9","why_studies","I guess the primary reason is money, despite how little it is. I guess the true answer is that during down time I believe it would be better to be productive in a small way, than no way at all. So I do it to fill time between actual work."

I would do this because I feel like writing poetry is something I've always been good at, and I'd like to be able to keep a selection of that work for future reference. I am proud of some of the work I've done in that regard, so I'd like to save it to remind myself that I actually have some talent. It would make me feel very unpleasant to know that those words were erased forever by flames."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","religious","I am not religious at all, but I am agnostic. When I was a child, my stepmother convinced me to get ""saved"" and become a Christian, but when I was a teenager, I disavowed my beliefs, mainly because I questioned why God would allow my mother to be tormented by her schizophrenia and, by extension, her children also suffered. I have yet to see any evidence that any religion is based on anything real; it's all based on belief in something that can't be proven. I see no reason to believe that will change, but I am open to believing if enough evidence is proffered."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","last_sing","I don't really sing that often, but there are rare occasions when I might sing to myself. I think the last time I did that was sometime last year, when I was in my apartment by myself listening to some music. I was singing the lyrics to myself and really getting into the music, and I felt pretty good at that time. The only time I recall singing to someone else was probably about ten years ago, when I was singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to a friend of mine, to jokingly impress them with the deepness of my voice."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","why_studies","The main reason I do online studies is for the compensation. I work on Mechanical Turk full-time, and I've found that many of the surveys that come up actually pay fairly well, especially compared to many of the other tasks that pay meager amounts. I feel like most surveys are fairly easy to get through, and it's also a nice break from the other types of work I do on Mechanical Turk, which often involve having to go very fast and rapidly entering data and selecting things quickly and so on."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","garden","I have no plants or gardens. I live in an apartment, and there is no ground that I could use for a garden. I have done indoor gardening in the past, but I have nothing going on in that regard right now. The only plants around my apartment are the shrubs and trees that were here when I moved in a couple of years ago."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","strangest","My home town is Benton, Kentucky, which is on the western end of Kentucky, with a population of about 5,000. The strangest thing about Benton would probably be the fact that it is extremely white. When I only saw one or two black people the entire time I was growing up, and there was only one non-white person in my high school class. I remember reading one of the '90s editions of ""The Book of Lists"" and seeing that my home county was actually listed as the whitest county in the United States by percentage."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","like_work","It sounds funny, but I would want to be a janitor. I am good at cleaning and am very fastidious, and I also really like working alone. I think it would give me lots of time by myself and would give me a chance just to think about things as I work. I also feel like cleaning is something that is valuable and that gives something back to society, even if others might look down upon those who do it."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","mind_body","I would like to retain the mind of a 30-year-old in that situation. I feel like mental decline is probably going to happen to me, since my grandfather ended up suffering from dementia after he surpassed the age of 70, so I'd like to keep my mind intact for those last years. I saw how difficult it was for him to have his mind destroyed there at the end, and I want to make sure I don't end up in a similar situation. As long as I have my mind, I will probably still be able to find things to entertain myself and find joy in as I age."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","famous","I wouldn't like to be famous at all. I prefer to keep to myself, and I don't want to have people prying into my personal history, especially since there are many things about my life that are kind of embarrassing and that I'm not proud of. I have a lot of social anxiety, so being famous would definitely make life a living hell, and that's something I would want to avoid at all costs."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby do was dance to a Beyonce song on YouTube. My friend was showing me some videos, and I saw this little girl dancing around to this Beyonce song, seeming to go along with the beat fairly well. It was pretty entertaining, and it was definitely very cute. I was smiling pretty broadly while watching her performance."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is understanding. I think friends should be able to understand where the other is coming from and be able to empathize and put themselves in the other person's shoes. Being able to understand your friend means that you won't be quick to judge someone else for their failings but will instead respond with compassion when they do bad things. I think this will result in longer-lasting friendships that have more depth to them."
"R_DqNzynJDRvYrBZL","how_raised","I would choose to be raised by my dad instead of my mom. My mother has schizophrenia, and when she and my dad got divorced, she got custody of me and my brothers. We grew up with her and lived with her constant shouting and screaming at the voices in her head, which caused me a lot of problems and has left me with many mental scars that will probably never heal. If I grew up with my dad, I would probably have had peace and comfort and a loving environment, since my dad is an honest and caring person, and I think that would have led to me being a more well-adjusted person today."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","cute_baby","I don't find babies or children very cute at all. I've never really understood people's fascination with them and find them incredibly uninteresting and usually gross. So I think the cutest thing I've seen a baby do is go away."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","famous","I don't think I would like to be famous because of all the hassle that comes with it. But I do think that I would enjoy being recognized on a large scale for something that I've done or accomplished. If I were to be famous for something I had achieved, rather than just for being famous, I think that would be alright. But again, becoming too famous is its own problem, as you lose all privacy and anonymity as a human being."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","like_work","At the moment, I'm unemployed and looking for work. I do like the sense of freedom I have. Even though I'm more restricted financially, I do have quite a bit of time on my hands to spend doing what I love to do, rather than what I feel forced to do. Plus, it's much easier to keep up on my daytime soap operas."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","fire_rescue","I would save a specific photo album from 1998. I would want to save this one because it has a picture inside it that has my entire immediate family playing with bubbles on a farm. This photo is important to me because my mom and brother have both died since then, and it's a very candid photo of all of us smiling and enjoying life together as a family."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","garden","I don't have any fruit trees, but I do have a garden. It's all pretty dead now because it's getting fairly cold here. I like to grow tomatoes and jalapenos. I grow those plants because they grow pretty easily, and I'm actually a pretty terrible gardener."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","how_raised","I would change how sheltered I was. I didn't go out much or meet new people, and that was never discouraged. I was allowed to be afraid of people and trying new things instead of encouraged to try and combat those tendencies. Now, I still am hesitant to try new things and meet new people, which isn't a fun way to live."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","last_sing","I last sang to myself this morning in the shower. I sang Bridge over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel, and I think I did a pretty good job of it. I can't remember the last time I sang to someone else, though. While I think I can sing, I would never want someone else to know that."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","friend_value","The thing I value most in a friendship is trust. Not just that I can trust my friend to tell me the truth all the time, but rather that I can trust them to be there for me when I need them, and that they can trust me to do the same. Trust is a two way street, and being able to have that sense of security between two people is the key to a strong and lasting friendship."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","mind_body","I would rather have the mind of a 30-year old. For one, I've had relatives who have gotten dementia and other such diseases. I've seen how those people are really no longer themselves when they've lost their minds. I wouldn't want to have that happen to me."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","religious","I am not a religious person. I think it's probably because my family isn't very religious to begin with. I never went to church or any other religious service. I also think that religion and believing in god just doesn't make sense to me logically, so I've remained irreligious as an adult."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","why_studies","I do these online studies for the money, mostly. But I also do them because some of them are really quite enjoyable. There are studies that pay a lot of money that I don't do because they aren't interesting to me. Plus, I have way too much time on my hands."
"R_DvZTwx9sZpq5SbT","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the local news stations. The city is big enough that there is enough news to talk about for about five minutes, and that news is quite serious. But after that, they still have thirty minutes to fill, and so the stations resort to weird tactics to keep people interested. They like to make small stories seem extremely important or highlight things that don't matter in a way to make them seem like they do."

"R_e4CXSPvDXYuoOI1","friend_value","The most important thing for me in a friendship is the ability to have interesting conversations.  If a person is my friend, then if I can't talk to them then I become uninterested in continuing the friendship.  Other aspects are just little extras in this case. "
"R_e4CXSPvDXYuoOI1","religious","No, I am not a religious person.  I do not believe in any kind of faith because it is not rational. As a rational person who puts my faith in science I can't accept the beliefs that religions try to impose reality. "
"R_e4CXSPvDXYuoOI1","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was the lack of diversity.  I grew up in a place that was mostly farmland and you would have to drive your car at least 15 minutes to get anywhere.  There was a lack of diversity in the type of people and the cultures that were around that area. "
"R_e4CXSPvDXYuoOI1","famous","No, I would not like to be famous.  I just personally don't really care about fame.  I believe that being famous would come with too many hassles and would ultimately be annoying. "

Honestly, I am not all that concerned about the physical aspects of reality so much as I am concerned about the mental ones.  I would rather be able to continue to use my brain for the betterment of society then to be able to do athletic things. "

So if one of these items was much safer than the other, or I could possibly grab both, I would try. But my first instinct would be to grab my bass. "

I'm 29 now and already feel my body slowing down. I have to watch what I eat and have had trouble with a few of my organs and joints, even though I'm a healthy weight and active. But mentally I'm as sharp as ever, and most people under 70 or 80 still seem pretty sharp to me. "

Intelligence and emotional intelligence are important as well. "

"R_O3ZHkjCqF7e9aSt","how_raised","I wish my parents had made me more disciplined. My childhood was very happy and pleasant, but I was not challenged to be disciplined. As a result, I turned out to be a lazy student and had trouble adjusting to adult life. My parents were kind of hippies, and while their accepting, loving attitudes have made me a good person in a lot of ways, I do wish I had better skills at doing things that are boring or dull."
"R_O9DUAZoSfwDvQCl","religious",", Instead I would say that I am spiritual. To me, when I hear the word religious, I think of white gloves and rules and regulations of the church. Those things did not come from God. These were men's interpretation of the Bible, but instead of teaching God's word they are trying to control people. Religion and spirituality differ because at least with spirituality, you are serving God, you are honoring purpose and direction in life as it applies to how you treat people and how you love yourself. Religious people are too worried about the building of the church whereas spirituality focuses on the actual church because that is the people, the people are the church. So I am spiritual, not necessarily religious."
"R_O9DUAZoSfwDvQCl","why_studies","I did on my studies because I wanted to enroll myself in the two-year paralegal program, but my mom had just been diagnosed with cancer and I needed to leave Virginia and moved to Wisconsin to be her caretaker. I did not want to have to put my entire life on hold in order to take care of her, and I also needed something to focus on outside of taking care of her and being consumed by the illness. So even though I was living in response and at the time of being in school, I was able to take the online classes for the school in Virginia that I will return to at a later time. Long story short, when my mom passed away, I moved back to Virginia year later. At that time I was only 18 credits away from being able to graduate with a degree. If it was not for having the ability to take online classes, I would have been starting at the beginning, but instead I was nearly done. And all my classes were able to help me be further in my life at a time when I desperately needed because my entire world had changed and I needed a fresh start in life and that gave a path to to feel like I was being productive and effective and progressing in life."

With my mom being deceased, that was one of the main reasons why I decided to create this safe box so that way I knew everything I needed was in one central place, and if there was ever a situation where there was only one thing that I could take with me if I was leaving, or grab and a emergency situation, I knew that my whole life and the things most important to me that I cannot live without are in this box and it is easily accessible for me to get to, so I would grab that if nothing else."

So the cutest thing that my son has ever done, when I think back, as when he was a baby. We were in a car accident, and which case he suffered a head and eye injury. I remember looking at him in the backseat crying and screaming as blood was rushing out of his head. I was so scared that something would be wrong with him, or worse. And while I waited in the emergency room all I pray for was that my baby was okay. But when the nurse came to the waiting room and told me that I could see my son, and that he was okay after surgery, me and his father ran to the back room where he was. As soon as I walked through the door, his face lit up. His eyes seem to get brighter and wider, they glistened with love and admiration for me. He was only eight months old, and had just been in a car accident where his head and I have been cut open, and just finish undergoing plastic surgery, and yet he was wide awake, happy, smiling and glowing like an angel. It brought me to tears to see him look so beautiful and happy to see me because I was so happy to see him."

I actually listen to music when I'm working sometimes, and I will sing along with the songs to myself, or even find myself singing the song long after the music is off. So the last time that I thought to myself was this morning as I was listening to the radio making coffee and eating breakfast to get my day started"
"R_O9DUAZoSfwDvQCl","mind_body","I would rather have the body of a 30 year old, because at 90 you so, you are wise, intelligent, and have lived nearly a century. That means you understand people, you understand life and how things work on a level that a 30-year-old could never comprehend. At 30 years old, your mind is still young, you still have a whole lot to learn about life so you're still making mistakes. At that point you are starting to figure things out, but you have not figured it out yet, but at 90, you have definitely figured it out. So I would take the 90-year-old brain and a 30-year-old body which will make you wise, smart and beautiful. "

Not poor as far as financially, but they have an eagerness to want more in life, but it is all talk. Many of them are not willing to put in the work for the life that they want, yet they can talk about it as if they know it very well. It is almost like people are bipolar in that city because the person you meet out in public many times is not the person that they are, and it is it has nothing to do with anything else except for the things that they are going to tell you about themselves. They are going to tell you things about themselves that they did not even need to mention in the first place, but they were so compelled to date, only for you to find out that it was a complete lie or that they added more juice to the story to make it more appealing when that was not a true representation of what the situation really is concerning what they're doing in their life"
"R_O9DUAZoSfwDvQCl","how_raised","There actually is nothing about my childhood that I would change. Do not get me wrong, I had a rough childhood. My father was not there, my mother was disabled and we were poor. We lived in the projects, and I was bussed out to suburban area schools. That meant that all the kids who I went to school with were well-to-do. They came from homes where they have both parents, both of the parents had good paying jobs, and they could do things that I had only dreamed of. Yet and still, I did not envy their life. There were times where I resented my life, but those were in the moments when I did not realize the value of my life experiences. She all of those bad things that I could name off to you in my past have all become steppingstones that have allowed me to progress in life, be a better person, and have the ability to see different perspectives. Those lessons have been so valuable, and I'm certain that even taking one event away from my life would change who I am today. I love who I am today, I am brace everything that's is good or bad about me and accept it. To this nothing that needs to be changed now, and there was nothing I could think of that would have been better a different way and my past regardless of how painful, hurtful or isolating that event or time.

When my mom was living, and she bought her house, I always told her that I would plant a garden in the backyard. After she passed away, I did start a very small project, as a way of dealing with my grieving, but I ended up leaving the house and left the garden behind. Now that I have my own house, I have said many times that I was going to start a garden. And I had a friend that's encouraged me to start one, even by giving me some seeds and tips on how to start the garden using plastic containers and dirt so that I would not have to dig the earth in my yard. I just never felt the energy to do it during the spring, so it is still on my to do list. But I am determined that one day I will get into it, hopefully it won't have to wait until I have retired and I am gardening because I'm old and bored or lonely"

I am not concerned about what a person can do for me, what they bring to the table in terms of benefits, nor do I judge them based on what they look like or what race they are. If you have a good heart, a pure spirit, you respect me, you're honest with me, and you communicate well with me, then we can be friends and our friendship can be strong as long as it is built on loyalty."

I always found it strange that children can find out that Santa isn't real and grow up without issue, but if you try to take religion away from certain people, they'll freak out. It's basically the same idea as far as I'm concerned: do good in your life, and you'll be rewarded. Do badly and you'll be punished. How is religion any different from Santa? Why do you follow religion but refuse to believe that Santa exists?"

"R_poTVUSG6ylIfbVL","how_raised","I would want my parents to have given me more structure. I feel like I grew up to only do what I wnat when I want to. It's my nature. So I could have used a lot more structure to force me to learn to be disciplined with my time. More than that, I simply wish my parents hadn't argued and fought so much."

"R_poTVUSG6ylIfbVL","mind_body","I used to say mind, but I think body. I really fear the decline of old age, how it renders you unable to take care of yourself. I know I value my mind and always have, above my physical self. But as I get older I think having a fit and healthy body is every bit as important, and more so as you age."
"R_poTVUSG6ylIfbVL","friend_value","I value someone who is there for me. I've had friends in my life who always seemed to treat people like peripherals, who wanted my help when they were in trouble but were never there for me when I needed someone to talk to. I also value honesty. Someone who lies to me or lies to others is simply intolerable, and there's no trust there. "
"R_poTVUSG6ylIfbVL","fire_rescue","The first thing that comes to mind is my blanket. I've had it since I was born. My mom made it for me. It's because of what it represents I guess. A safe place, love, comfort. It's the one thing I have always, always had. But so many other things come to mind soon after, and picking one is too hard. The camera my grandaddy had when he was deployed in WW2, or his helmet that has a bullet hole in it. My hard drive with all my writing on it. "
"R_pRSs6nm3zpr1NIt","fire_rescue","It would be my money. Money would be important to helping us survive until we are able to get a new place to live. Money would also help us rebuild our lives."

"R_pRSs6nm3zpr1NIt","garden","We don't have any fruit trees at our house, but we did plant a garden this year. We had a lot of tomatoes and peppers, and several herbs. We also had tomatillos and cucumbers. We will probably have an even bigger garden next year."

I was raised catholic and when I wanted to explore religion and find a different church, I was shamed a lot about leaving the church I was raised in. Because of this I kind of feel away from religion and I haven't been to church or practiced in years."
"R_QbSsFk6X1F2C62J","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30-year old for sure. I don't worry about my mind as much, unless I were to develop dementia or Alzheimers. But I don't want to have a slow achy body, I want to continue living and exploring the world until I die."
"R_QbSsFk6X1F2C62J","garden","I have a few fruit trees. We currently have a young peach, apple, and pear tree. I'm not very good at growing plants but I have gotten better and I plan on starting a garden and slowly growing it depending on how successful I am."

He has been playing with a little basketball for the past few months and was not able to put it in the goal because he could not walk. The other day I went over there and he had just learned to walk. Even though he was a bit wobbly on his feet, he walked right over to the goal and put the ball in. He started clapping afterwards. It was so cute. "

"R_QfvoKuhoz7mRwKl","strangest","I grew up in my grandparents home. My biological mom and dad did not want to take care of me so my grandparents adopted me and took me in as one of their own. I got to be with my grandma and grandpa daily. It was great. "

"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","strangest","The people by far were the strangest. I grew up in a big city with a very diverse population. Different cultures, ethnicity, and economic backgrounds. Lots of perceived bad people on bottom and the rich and good people on the top. I learned a lot about how really backward that perception is. "
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","cute_baby","The cutest thing I ever saw a baby do was years go but still cracks me up to this day. It was my little nephew, he was only about two months old drinking out of a straw. I don't have any idea how my sister taught him to do it but she did. The drink was cold so every time after he would suck on the straw he would smack his lips, make an ah sound and a really funny face. He really liked it and would do it over and over. "
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","mind_body","I would definitely want to retain the mind of a 30 year-old. I would want to know what is going on around me, who I was with and most importantly remember my family. For me it is hard to imagine and even sad for me to think about not recognizing my children and other family members. I would even say that is one of the things that I fear about growing older."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","why_studies","I do them for a couple of reasons. The first would be that I earn income from participating in them. Second to that I do find them interesting and researchers need participants to be able to better understand our world and the people in it. Why not me, is how I think about it."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","fire_rescue","The one item would definitely be my keepsake box. I have everything stored there in the event something like that would happen. I have all of my important documents, like birth certificates, financial information and so on. I also keep important memory items in it like photos, videos, SD cards, small souvenirs for my children and anything else I feel is a must have item."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","garden","I do have plants and a small garden. The plants are mostly indoor plants which include a couple of Air-ferns  and a few Pothos plants. The small garden is in my back yard, I grow cucumbers, corn, green beans and a few herbs. Occasionally I will plant other seeds that I think look interesting when I come across them while out shopping."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","last_sing","Funny question, the last last time that I sang to myself was just the other morning in the shower. I do that occasionally when I am in a good mood. I also, sing to my children regularly. So the last time I sang to someone else was just yesterday, to my son. I tucked him in and sang him a lullaby before he fell asleep. "
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","friend_value","I think friendship has lots of different dynamics and what I value most in those relationships can vary depending on the friend. When I look at my friends as a group, I would say that I value them being themselves in the friendship most. I wouldn't want friends that are fake and put on a show to get along with others. I value and care about genuine people and hope the relationship is reciprocal. "
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","how_raised","Everything, I had a rough time growing up which is difficult for me to talk about. For the most part, I don't talk about it because thinking about it causes me lots of emotional distress. So when I say everything I mean my parents, my living conditions, economic conditions, the place I grew up and even all of my relatives. I think the only thing that I would keep is my brother."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","like_work","I am a Production Engineer for a manufacturing company. I really so like most all aspects of my job, especially because I work independently for most part. I free to manage my time so long as I meet my deadlines and get things done according to policy. I also enjoy that there are always new things to work on and figure out."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","religious","That would be a yes and a no, I would say more spiritual. I don't go to church but I do believe in god. I was raised in a very religious family which I think was not good for me and amounted to a lot of bad experiences."
"R_QgKZIvojjxm2bnz","famous","No, I would not want to be famous. That would be way to much hassle for me. I am more of a laid back type. I like the quiet and easy going kinda life style, drink coffee on the porch early in the morning person."

"R_Qoe2Nh4N30BKJHj","strangest","I grew up in the country so there were a lot of strange things. When I was in high school it wasn't taboo for kids to have guns and gun racks inside their cars. Occasionally there would be dead deer in the back of the trucks too during hunting season."
"R_Qoe2Nh4N30BKJHj","friend_value","I'd say loyalty and honesty are two of the most important things in a friendship. It's good to know that your friend will be on your side and helpful when things go wrong. It is also good to have an honest friend who will be straight forward with you."
"R_Qoe2Nh4N30BKJHj","mind_body","I would want to continue to have the body of a 30 year old. It would be strange to not mature mentally any further than 30. It would also be weird though to have a banging body at 90."

Thankfully most of my new pictures are on the cloud (thank you technology!) but all of my old one's are still in a shoebox that I have had since I was a teenager.  It's all of the memories I have from growing up and I love being able to look at them and remember ""the good old days""."

"R_qQnliFbQiStrXI5","religious","No, I'm not a religious person.  I think that religion is a very personal thing and I'm not at all against it.  I just feel that most people need religion because they are afraid of death, life, and what comes after.  I don't feel I need that reassurance in this life."

"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","garden","I have a venus fly trap. I purchased it last summer simply for the novelty. It actually came from the grocery store. I have since take care of it and developed even a small attachment for it."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","cute_baby","I saw a baby take it's father's hand from it's mother. It was like the baby wanted to hold hands with the father. It was very cute. It was quite innocent and funny."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","like_work","I am an office clerk. I like that it involves using my mind to some degree rather than manual labor. It is not what I want to do forever. It is effectively paying my bills right now though. It's okay."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","mind_body","I would want the mind. I am very much a cerebral, intelligent person. My mind is much stronger than my body. I would want to keep it strong. It is how I most strongly identify."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","strangest","I would say the strangest thing is simply that it is very small. As a result, almost everyone knows everyone. I have also lived in larger cities and it is very different. It is quite strange to reflect back on growing up in such a place where privacy was rare."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","how_raised","I would have been around children more. I was an only child and my parents didn't make a very strong effort to have me around other children. I believe it helped lead me to become very shy. Even to this day I am shy and reserved. I believe it I were raised differently in this way, I may not have turned out this way to such a degree."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","famous","I would not like to be famous. I am actually a rather private person. I like time to myself. I also do not like crowds. I believe any positive feeling I received from being famous would fade very quickly. I like my alone time."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","friend_value","I value reliability. I have come across many people who turned out to be very unreliable. They were hard to count on and trust. As a result, I very much enjoy and value a friend who is true to their word and can be counted on. It is a sometimes rare trait. It is very important however."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","why_studies","I like to make a little extra money. I find it to be a very productive use of time. It keeps me from engaging in something totally unproductive and it keeps me from being bored. I also learn interesting facts sometimes."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","last_sing","I last sang to myself when I was driving to pick up my fiance from the airport. It was a 30 minutes drive and a great song came on. It was a great way to pass the time. I actually also sang it to her on the way back too."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","religious","I am religious. I was raised as a Christian, Baptist specifically. I continue to be this way. I am not one hundred percent sure about what is out there but I do believe God is quite possible. I believe religion also provides a great moral framework for navigating the world."
"R_qX6YjIzUkhP03lv","fire_rescue","I would save a wool coat I own. It was actually given to me by my grandmother. She has since passed. It is a warm reminder of her. I would not want to lose it as it has high sentimental value. Besides, it's a very nice coat."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","friend_value","I don't take friendship too seriously. People are people and if they don't get in my way I won't get in theirs. So I guess that'd have to be it; I like people to mind their own business and I'll mind my own."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","famous","No, I'm not really interested in fame. I'd rather live a life free of scrutiny, without having to watch everything I do all the time in fear someone might be offended. Much better that way."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","mind_body","If I had the body of a 30 year old at 90, I'd still be working my ass off, so I think I'll pass on that one. Let me have a sharp mind, even if my body is going to shit. At least that way I'll be able to enjoy a retirement - hopefully."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","like_work","I work as a security consultant. I contract with different companies to analyze and assess their physical and information security. I train security guards and perform security audits, which help companies solve their security problems. It's also useful to submit these reports to their insurance providers which allows them to receive a higher security rating and lower their insurance premiums."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","strangest","I grew up in a town founded about 200 years ago to cater to the mining community where I live. It used to be a swamp but it was filled in with trash and debris that was imported from nearby industrial sites. The whole town is literally a slag heap."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","garden","I have a garden that I don't really tend too often. Actually it's more like a patch of squash, pumpkins, onions, and Jerusalem choke that grows in my yard without me having to pay much mind to it. It's good for a meal or two when things are looking lean around here."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","religious","Not at all. I'm an empiricist at heart. I don't believe in anything I can't see with my own eyes or hear from a reputable source."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","how_raised","My parents were pretty strict and over-protective. I think I missed out on a lot because of that. I think it really stunted my emotional intelligence."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","last_sing","I sing all the time. Always singing along to music when it's playing. I sing to friends and family when they're around, too. I don't think they like hearing it as much as I like to do it."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","why_studies","I do it because I need cash. Simple really. Always need more money."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","cute_baby","Kids are adorable. I can't really be specific but I always appreciate seeing a kid who's curious about the world and interested in learning new things. It gives one hope for the future."
"R_r2NNyvobDkeezLP","fire_rescue","I'd say my computer because it has so much valuable information on it and is pretty valuable itself, but the info's all backed up and I can replace the computer. I suppose it'd have to be my gun case, just because its contents are more valuable than anything else I own. Probably about $4,000 worth of firearms in there, as well as some family heirlooms."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","religious","No, I'm not religious. I went to church as a kid but lost interest in my teen years. I've never heard a satisfactory answer to the question of why God would force so many to suffer so horribly on Earth. So, even if there is a God, I'm not going to pay any attention to Him."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","garden","Yeah, I do. I have a couple cacti. I live in a condo and spend a lot of time away from home so potted plants tend to die on me. The cacti do just fine on their own for long stretches."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","last_sing","I sing to me dog every day. I have a very weak voice so I'm trying to strengthen my vocal chords. I sing to my dog in this exaggerated, deep baritone in the hopes it'll give me a voice a little more projection."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","why_studies","I just want to make money. I don't earn enough in my regular job to have a great lifestyle. I don't even get health care from that job. I do online studies and other kinds of work so I can have a decent life."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","strangest","I grew up just North of the Mason Dixon Line. For whatever reason, everyone around there identified as Southern regardless. I never understood it. They even rooted for out of state sports teams and colleges just because they were in a Dixie state."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","friend_value","The thing I want most out of my friendships is to have a good time. I don't need close companionship or a shoulder to cry on. I just want someone with a great sense of humor who isn't uptight and who likes to do things that I like to do."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","mind_body","I would want the body of a 30 year old. There are plenty of 90 year olds with sharp minds. I could survive just fine with some diminished mental abilities. I've never seen a 90 year old who could run a 5 minute mile, though. It'd be such an astonishing feat that I'd earn millions from showing it off. Plus I'm a very active person and I hate medical procedures. Old, achy joints and numerous doctor visits sound torturous to me."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","fire_rescue","I'd have to save my laptop. I've got all my pictures, music, books, and work documents saved on it. It's really the only irreplaceable item I own."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","how_raised","I would love it if I could replace all the hours I spend learning, practicing, and playing sports with something more interesting like music or science education. I was pushed into sports as a very young kid and I was fairly good at a lot of them. Looking back now all those thousands of hours feel like a complete waste. All these things I wish I knew and everything I feel insecure about are things I could've been learning and experiencing instead of playing sports."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","cute_baby","My friend's daughter thinks the word for a butterfly is butterbye. And she thinks everything that flies is a butterfly. Every time she goes outside she runs around pointing at things and squealing, ""Butterbye! Butterbye!"" The laughs she gets for it only encourage her to call more things by that name."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","famous","I guess I would, yeah. The thing that everyone says is the biggest downside - the lack of privacy - isn't really a problem for the vast majority of famous people. The benefits, on the other hand, in terms of your earning potential, preferential treatment, and things like that are pretty large. The only exception is that I wouldn't want to be famous for anything that would make people hate me like committing a murder."
"R_r8x7KbmIbflGf4Z","like_work","I'm a tutor. I help students who are struggling or who want more help than they can get in the classroom. I like helping people learn. I like knowing that some of the things I teach them will stay with them forever and improve their quality of life."
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","how_raised","I would stop having my ass kicked all the time. Instead of getting mad when i wanted to be different, they could of let me keep on what im doing. People are afraid of things they dont understand and my parents didnt understand most of the things i was about"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","mind_body","I would want to become a contestant on a quiz show or something to use all the knowledge i could remember. I would will the money and sail around the world which would be interesting to do"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","last_sing","I sung this morning to myself because I had a song stuck in my head. You know what they say about having a song stuck in your head. You have to hear it again to get it out. I sung to my son last night to get him to sleep "
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","why_studies","I mostly do it for the money. Then there are some studies that are super interesting so it keeps me going in slow times. I also wonder what they are researching sometimes. Makes me wonder whats going on with things, just like this survey"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","like_work","I normally fix computers and networks at a small company. I like the fact that I have time to just sit back and think when there is a big problem. Too many jobs are rush rush rush to get something figured out and you end up messing up"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","garden","I currently do not have any kind of plants around my house. Its all sand and rocks so its hard to grow anything. I would love to have a fruit tree but again, they dont like dry sandy soil"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","cute_baby","I once saw my son burp and get scared from his own burp. It sad for a second but then he calmed down and started smiling so it was so cute. I never seen anything as cute, even things on cat videos"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","famous","I think i would be okay being famous but I wouldnt be one of those people who you can say hi to in the store and not worry about people taking you down. I would be famous but for the people like someone who ended homelessness or something noble"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","friend_value","I value that even after we can have issues and fight. We can get mad at each other and not talk but after a while we are still friends. There are too many people who stop being friends after stupid reasons these days. "
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","strangest","I spent some of my time in ohio. It was in the middle of nowhere so there wasnt much around. Lots of forest and a river but that was about it. I found it strange that people wanted to grow up out here"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","fire_rescue","I would save the memory box. Everything in the house is replaceable beyond that, though having memories when your old cant be replaces. Especially since its all about my son growing up"
"R_rduBrqNQ0Kil0rf","religious","I am sort of a religious person. I tend to boarder on the religious and the spiritual side of life. I guess its mostly to feel like im not alone in the world when things go out of wack. "
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","fire_rescue","I'd probably grab my fireproof safe. I know that it's supposed to be fireproof, but I don't think I'd trust it 100%. It has important paperwork and an external drive of years of pictures that I wouldn't be able to replace."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","mind_body","I would choose the body. I'd want my mind to age as I learn more and become more wise. On the other hand, your body is going to slowly give out and cause you more pain. I know there are diseases and disorders that can tear apart an aging mind too, but I'd take my chances and keep my mind."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","strangest","I can't really think of anything that was strange about where I grew up. However, while I was a child my neighbor across the street was convicted of sexual assault of my next door neighbor who was the same age as me. I had been in his house before without an adult, so I consider myself lucky. That's probably the strangest thing that I can think of."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","friend_value","I value dependability most in a friendship. I've had friends that never follow through when we make plans and always cancel with me at the last minute. How can you consider someone a friend if you can't ever meet up with them?"
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","how_raised","When I was only 9, my father died. If I could have changed that I definitely would have. My mother kind of tried to raise us, however I can't help but feel that growing up would have been much more enjoyable had he been around. I also have so many questions that I'd love to ask him, but I'l never get the chance now."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","cute_baby","That's a tough question, since I have two children that I've seen do a ton of cute things. I can't really remember everything that they've done that's really cute, however one that sticks out in my mind is my son that's just learning to talk. A couple weeks ago he said ""love you, so much"". It's not just what he said but how he said it that made it so cute."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","religious","No, I'm not really religious. I was raised as a Lutheran, but over time I began to have more and more questions and it just seemed like I wasn't getting any real concrete answers. I was told to have faith. Well, that really wasn't enough for me. So, no I'm not a religious person."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","like_work","I'm a teacher. I like that I have a direct impact in my student's lives and I feel like I'm making a difference. Some days are better than others, but overall I enjoy it."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","last_sing","The last time I sang to myself was in my car on my way here. You know the feeling when a song you haven't heard in a long time just pops up on the radio and you can't help but to let it out. To someone else? Probably my husband in a joking manner a week or so ago. You know, just playing around."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","why_studies","I do these online studies mostly to make a little extra money. I use the money for little purchases throughout the year. Right now, I'm using the money to buy the Christmas presents for my children. Some studies are boring, however others are very interesting and enjoyable. It's also a good use of my down time."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","garden","I had a garden with a ton of vegetables and fruits for about two years. However, gardens attract animals that I'd rather not have in my backyard, considering that I have two small children. After I found a rattlesnake underneath my kid's slide, I got rid of the garden. While tearing everything out I found  numerous lizards and a baby bird that couldn't fly hidden in the raspberry bush."
"R_ronz1HcwMB3sjCx","famous","I would not want to be famous in any way imaginable. People can be weirdly obsessed with famous people pry too much into their lives. I value my privacy too much to have any desire to be famous. I'm content blending into the background."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","how_raised","My childhood, while happy on the outside, was full of low-key emotional abuse. My dad is/was an alcoholic, and my mom is a classic co-dependent enabler. She was so controlling over my brother and myself. I felt incredibly sheltered for most of my childhood. I think if I could change anything it would be to have a ""normal"" family, absent of alcoholism or codependency."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","cute_baby","When my daughter was just learning how to walk, we had this long, low coffee table in our living room. I used to line cheerios all along the edge of the coffee table and she would hang on with one hand, and work her way around the table, picking up the cheerios and eating them. That was pretty dang cute."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","religious","I'm completely not a religious person. I wasn't raised religious, but my mom started attending church and was ""born again"" when I was in my last year of high school. I used to attend services with her sometimes, just as a way to spend time with her. But, I just always felt out of place. I have a more scientific, rational mind, and I just have a hard time blindly believing in God."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","why_studies","I'm a stay at home mom, with a huge student loan debt. Now that my kids are older, I have more time to try and make some money, but not really enough time to get a part time job. So, by doing these studies, I can make enough to pay my student loan payment. But also, most of the studies are interesting to me, and I enjoy reading about the research goals and hypotheses."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","famous","My first thought is to stay no, because I wouldn't want all of the attention, paparazzi, all the time, et cetera. But, I think I wouldn't mind being famous for being a celebrated humanitarian, or a nobel prize winner. Or if I could publish a best selling book under a pseudonym and be anonymously famous."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","last_sing","I have such a terrible singing voice, but I really do love to sing. I sing to my kids all the time, and I'm sure I sang something to them yesterday. I can't remember what it was, but I can remember my daughter trying to put her hand over my mouth because she doesn't like it when I sing."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","like_work","I don't have a ""job"" right now. I'm a stay at home mom. But I do have several income streams that I'm working on to try and make an income. My full time job is taking care of my kids. I thought that would get easier as they get older, but it seems every stage is just as hard as the last, just in a different way. It's great to be able to watch them grow and be here for them when they need me."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","garden","I love to garden! This year I had my husband build me some garden boxes in the front yard, and I planted all sorts of things. Nothing really grew that well. I was able to harvest some squash, and one tomato. The thing I really love about gardening is it's trial and error. If something doesn't work one year, you can tweak your plans and try again the next year."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","strangest","I grew up in San Diego, CA, and we lived in a fairly suburban neighborhood. But for some reason the people who lived across the street from us had a huge property. They enough land to have horses. There was a little creek close by and whenever it would rain the creek would flood, and maybe once a year our whole street would flood. I remember the man across the street rowing a boat full of hay into his backyard so he could go feed his horses."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","mind_body","I would definitely want the mind of a 30-year old. What's the point of having the mind of a 90-year old, with the possibility of dementia, and the body of a 30-year old? I'd much rather retain my mental acuity."
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","fire_rescue","I don't have anything in my house that I would risk my life trying to save. The most valuable things I have in my life are my family and my animals. I can't think of one thing I could absolutely not live without. "
"R_RPjDHHPAulCEsEN","friend_value","I've recently been going through some hard times, and have pulled away from many of my close friends. I've felt really dissatisfied with the quality of people I decide to be friends with. Now, I'm really trying to be more choosy about who I share my life with. I want people in my life who bring positivity, honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to share their lives and passions with me."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","why_studies","I need the money. This is my full time job and I use the money to survive. I treat this as my profession."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","how_raised","I would have choosen a different town to grow up in. I did not enjoy living in the city that I grew up in. There were not alot of opportunities for expansive growth."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","last_sing","I sang to friends of mine in a group discussion. I was half-joking when I was singing, just making up a tune. Sometimes that is enough too loosen people up."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","cute_baby","I saw a kid contradict his mother repeatedly in a video. He was being honest and truthful, but he would not give in to her. The mother tried to change his mind, but he would not."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","fire_rescue","I would definitely save my laptop. It is the only real thing of value that I own. Without my laptop, I cannot make a living. It would very expensive to try and replace it."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","friend_value","I value honesty the most. I like it when people are willing to be honest with me. I can use honest feedback to change, but only when people are courageous enough to share it."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","famous","I would not like to be famous. I like my privacy and don't want people to pay attention to me. I dislike attention and seek to avoid it."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","religious","No, I am not religious. I am however, spiritual. I do not follow an organized religion as spirituality is what I need because it is more subjective."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","strangest","The buildings were all cold during the winter time. Every building that I went into was drafty and cold. It wasn't just one building, but all of them. "
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","like_work","I Turk for a living. It's great to make your own schedule and be able to choose the work that you do. People would be alot more effective in their jobs if they had more choices like this."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","mind_body","I would not want to live until 90. I have had enough of this life and can't go much further. If I had to choose though having a sharper mind is much more important."
"R_RWShFLRXLGvzclP","garden","No, I don't. I used to have a garden that I worked in when I lived in Miami. I do miss it a great deal. It was great to put your hands in the dirt and feel the earth."

"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","why_studies","I do these online studies to save money for the future.  This future would be for emergencies, my son's education, future investment in cryptocurrency.  Also to give my family more spending room.  Our family bills keep our budget tight.  With the extra income we can put some relief on our budget and have extra income so we don't live paycheck to paycheck."
"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","religious","I am a religious person.  I believe we need to look up to something to live a normal life without stress. madness and chaos.  We need a guide just like at work each employee has a handbook that we follow, or standard operating procedures for machines and tecniques.  These guides, handbooks, and procedures make life less stressful and allow us to move forward without wasting time and going back to understand all over again.  "
"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","strangest","The strangest thing was having to switch schools more times than I remember.  I remember different schools and I do not know why I kept changing.  I donot remember getting into any fights or anything to get myself into trouble.  "
"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","garden","I have no fruit trees, plants or a garden.  My mother who has alzheimer's would pull out the plants and ruin the trees so I just got rid of it.  The time cleaning the mess was a waste."
"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","mind_body","I would choose the mind.  I am currently taking care of my mother who has Alzheimer's and it is not something I would want when I get older. She can not eat, dress, go to the bathroom or find her way around by herself.  It is very sad, she no longer knows the current time or place.  It is like she is only a shell of a person.  If I had the mind I would still be aware and living even though I would be weak.  I can rely on others and communicate with them still."
"R_s74nrq49CxtA8DL","cute_baby","A baby smiling.  It is just the cutest thing to see a baby smile. Especially when they smile at you, it makes you think they is something good in you to make a baby so innocent to recognize it."

She was asking several questions and he happily answered all of them.  She then looks up at him and says, ""Daddy, I love you.""  This literally almost brought tears to my eyes.  "
"R_T64ZgGfepBSV18B","why_studies","The main reason I do the studies is that it provides extra income for my family.  I'm a divorced mother of two and I live in a very expensive state.  These studies provide part time income without having a part time job."

"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","how_raised","One thing that I would change about the way I was raised, is that I would want to live in a place that had more country side around it. I have always loved nature and valued the times we went camping as a child, but it just wasn't enough. I think that having miles and miles to explore out in nature would have been a great thrill ride for me. "

If I can not trust you to do the right thing, or if I have to worry about you going behind my back, then I would rather not be friends with you. "
"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","mind_body","I would want the body of a 30 year old for the last 30 days. I'd figure that my body has been declining since the age of 50. That is 40 years of not being able to do what I did as a kid. I would want to experience that thrill again of being physically fit and being able to go anywhere you wanted to."

I have no problem with retirees and think they are quite pleasant, but the sheer number of them is staggering. I think that there are more retirement home there than there are food stores and gas stations. "
"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","famous","I would not like to be famous. Constantly being in the spot like and being followed around by people trying to take my picture would drive me insane.

"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","religious","I am not a religious person. I grew up in a semi-religious family and never liked it. All the rules about what you need to eat and having to go to church every week was pointless for me. Also, giving ten percent of what you make to the church is ridiculous. "

"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","fire_rescue","The first thing that come to mind is my cell phone and its charger. It has all my contacts in it so that I can call them and find a place to stay. I would also use it to call the insurance company and get them dealing this this right away. "
"R_tGrBPF4mHLrOMiR","why_studies","I do these online studies because I think they are interesting. I like the different varieties and subjects that I come across. They also keep me a little up do date on what is being surveyed by public opinion polls. How people word questions differently is fun to see as well. "

"R_uey5dVulZ9v8vPH","fire_rescue","I have thought about this many times. I would try to save photos if i could. Photos are almost like proof that things existed like your childhood. I was here, i looked like this. Without that its like you can only trust your memories and they are unreliable. "

"R_uey5dVulZ9v8vPH","religious","Yes, i didn't grow up in a religious home. I searched for God's calling and truth about what church to attend when i was 13 or 14. I visited a few churches and took a Bible Study and i found a church i believe preaches the true Gospel (United Pentecostal) and  i still attend twice a week church services till this day. I also volunteer for the church."

"R_uey5dVulZ9v8vPH","mind_body","Im tempted to say mind because i value my intellectual ability more than any other aspect of my personality. But i would probably choose body, because if your body is not in good health, living is a misery. Having a young body and being able to get around is something young people take for granted."
"R_uey5dVulZ9v8vPH","how_raised","I wish my parents were more open emotionally. They never really gave me good advice for choosing a mate, finances, or just life skills. I think because i was a good kid and smart they felt they didn't have to. They never really told me they loved me or that i was capable. I feel these things would have helped me become a more successful adult."

"R_UFThCyxz6lIr8op","fire_rescue","I feel sort of pathetic saying this, but it would probably be my phone.  I don't have a lot of sentimental possessions.  If my house burned down, it would make things slightly easier if I had my phone."

I would also have been raised by supportive people who taught me to be all that I can be, and that supported and encouraged me, instead of hindering me. I feel that if I had had that, I would be in a much better position than I am now. "
"R_UmaZCA076QKKt3P","friend_value","In a friendship, I value authentic, low drama people who say what they mean.

"R_UmaZCA076QKKt3P","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up was how few minorities there were. I think we maybe had 2 black kids in our entire school, and maybe a couple of other minorities sprinkled in. WAY too much whitewashing. "
"R_UmaZCA076QKKt3P","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a kid do was when my son was a toddler. He would get fussy in the car sometimes, or just stressed out in general. When he did, I would point out the window and say ""Look, a distraction!"" It always broke through his fussing and he would look for the distraction. The best time was when he responded ""Oh I see it!"" "
"R_UmaZCA076QKKt3P","mind_body","That's a hard one. I would love to have the body, and wouldn't the body of a 30-year old include the brain, and thus the mind? But if not, I think I would have to take the mind of a 30 year old. It would be more useful I think. "

"R_UMFbR1Ivi4YFsc1","how_raised","I would have my parents try to help me out when I was younger instead of treating me like an enemy. They were always screaming their heads off at me about my school performance. I had undiagnosed inattentive ADD which caused this. Maybe if they had helped me out instead of treating me like I was some kind of evil enemy because I didn't live up to their expectations my entire life might have turned out differently. "

I don't think most Christians have actually had experiences like I have."

"R_UMFbR1Ivi4YFsc1","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that it pretended to be decent and somewhat high class but it really wasn't. I grew up in a suburb of Flint, during the days of diminishing middle class factory jobs. The suburb had a lot of largely uneducated people that were able to scrape together a good living by a twist of fate of getting into GM at the right time. A lot of the middle class pretended to be of a slightly higher social class than they really were. "
"R_UMFbR1Ivi4YFsc1","cute_baby","The cutest thing I saw a baby do was my nephew laughing when I was playing peek a boo with him so many years ago.

You don't see that often from a baby."

I also rely on my laptop for work so if I did not have it, I would have no income. I also I have digital copies of all my important documents and photos so those would be saved as well. "
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","religious","I am not really. I only pray when I am scared or worried, and even then I don't honestly believe my prayers will be answered. I never go to church, but I was christened so I do consider myself to be Catholic, although I would never say that to a true Catholic."
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","how_raised","I wish I was raised with a healthier diet. I struggled with my weight for so many years. When I finally lost my weight, I realized that it would have been so much easier if my parents had raised me to eat better and to have a better relationship with food."
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","friend_value","I value honesty and loyalty. I want my friends to always tell me the truth, even when it is bad. I also want them to always be loyal. Nothing would hurt me more than a friend stabbing me in the back."
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","last_sing","I last sang to myself quite recently. I am at home alone all day so I often find myself singing a song that is caught in my head. With Christmas coming up, I've also been singing Christmas songs!"
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30-year-old. The body is what holds back most elderly people. I imagine I would likely still have a reasonably sharp mind so it would be more important to have a youthful (and therefore, healthy and able) body."
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","like_work","I work on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service. Essentially, I'm an independent contractor completing a variety of tasks for requestors. The pay is much lower than regular jobs, but I can work at home and make my schedule, so it is somewhat worth it. Sometimes, I feel incredibly undervalued though."
"R_Uzq7sCt9EJ35GjD","why_studies","I do it solely for money. I have some personal issues so I cannot work outside the home so I rely on these paid studies to give me a little bit of spending money. Some can be fun and entertaining but most are not so it is purely financially motivated."
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","friend_value","Just the simple being there for each other. Knowing that you can call that person up whenever and talk to them about whatever without them giving you crap for whatever it is. Being able to get suggestions from them on your situation at any time. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","mind_body","I would definitely choose to retain the body of a 30 year old. It would be very hard to have a sharp and strong mind but not be able to physically do anything that I once enjoyed. I love to be active and not being able to do that would not be very fun. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","cute_baby","Try to learn how to walk. I have 2 children who both are of walking age now, but I remember watching both of them bumble around trying to figure out how to walk upright on their own 2 feet. Falling down constantly and rolling around are the cutest. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","last_sing","I sing to myself in the car almost everyday. Sometimes it may be to songs on my iPod, sometimes just to random songs on the radio. I don't typically sing if others are in the car though, it's more of a solo thing. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","strangest","That the weather was very similar all year round. I grew up on a peninsula in California with the Pacific ocean one side and a large bay inlet on the other side. These combined get temperatures pretty similar, in the 70's, all year long. We never used an AC unit or a heater in our house. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","how_raised","I don't think that I would change anything about how I was raised. I really enjoyed my childhood and don't have many bad memories from it at all. I was lucky to grow up in one of the best places to live in the U.S., I grew up right on the beach, my parents had adequate money and I was able to do anything that I wanted. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","famous","No I would not like that. I typically am a pretty private person, so I don't think that I would like all that attention. I would love the money that would come with it, but might not be worth all of the things that would come along with it. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","fire_rescue","It would probably be my laptop computer. My laptop contains all of my important personal information, personal photos and a ton of other info on it that would be very hard to get back if I were to lose it for good. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","garden","No. I live in the desert with an all rock back yard and all rock front yard. We could probably grow a desert garden here, but it seems it would be a lot more work than it's worth. We have some desert plants mixed in our rocks but they are rather boring bushes and shrubs. "

We additionally work with store management to gain incremental displays to help push sales of our products. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","why_studies","I do these online studies as something to pass the time and make some extra money. At this current time, all the extra money will go towards Christmas gifts for my children. I do work full-time and make a decent living with that job to cover all of our basic needs but my earnings from surveys provides funds for additional fun family activities. "
"R_vl7YrssJC2ITXzz","religious","No I am not and I never have been. My parents never attending religious ceremonies when I was younger and so I never got into it. I have attending a few churches with significant others but it is nothing I would consider taking seriously. "
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","religious","No, I am not a religious person. Religion doesn't really do anything for me personally nor was I raised in any religious manner. I have nothing against it but it's just not for me."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","friend_value","Honesty is the greatest trait I could want in a friend. If you want to earn my friendship you need to be honest with me and yourself about everything that you want out of this relationship. If someone just doesn’t hear what you’re saying when you confide in them, they won’t make a very good friend. "
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","how_raised","Being raised by different people entirely or being raised in a group home. My childhood was abusive and lacked guidance at all phases. The people who ""raised"" me had no responsibility raising a kid."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","fire_rescue","I would probably try to save my laptop. I would save that because as a student it would have a lot of my assignments and study material I would need. It would also contain a lot of personal data that would be hard to replace."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","cute_baby","I was at a Thanksgiving dinner with an ex-girlfriend and her family. We were lounging out on the back patio and her niece comes over and starts grabbing anything and everything. My ex asked her ""What are you doing?"" to which the niece replied ""Taking things that aren't mine."" I guess theft is only cute when you're that age."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","famous","I think the only way I'd like to be famous is as a voice actor. I've always found the profession quite interesting and you can do a lot of unique things in that industry. I also appreciate how voice actors can keep a bit of anonymity about themselves too."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","last_sing","I last sung to myself yesterday evening driving home from work with the radio on. I sung to my girlfriend briefly this morning as she made fun of a hootie and the blowfish song. We probably sing to each other in that fashion quite often though."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","mind_body","I would want my 30 year old mind to stay with me. It's a lot harder to fix brain problems than body problems. I also think it may cause problems if you never saw yourself age."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","like_work","I currently work as a in-home caregiver for seniors. I enjoy it because it is meaningful work and serves an important purpose so seniors can have more independent years. I also like the fact that their scheduling works so well around my college schedule."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","why_studies","I do this studies mainly for the monetary benefits. The income from here isn't my primary source of income but it really helps covering bills or groceries. I also do enjoy the fact that a lot of the studies seem pretty important or meaningful."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","garden","I do not have any fruit trees, plants, or a garden. If I did have a fruit tree I'd love a lemon tree as lemon goes in so many recipes. I've pondered doing one of those indoor herb gardens too as that'd be handy."
"R_vTXbAV0PTrmFtVn","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the misassociation. I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and most people think of Orlando and Miami when thinking of Florida. Jacksonville might as well be south Georgia though as it is nothing like those cities."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","cute_baby","I saw my niece get really excited over her presents. She was so hyper and excited that it was really cute. She was still a very little kid and everyone that she was adorable. "
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","like_work","I am an applications programmer. I like the logic and problem solving aspects of programming. It lets me occupy my mind and keeps me busy all day. I enjoy finding novel ways to solve problems in the code."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","last_sing","I don't sing that much. I was singing a few bars from that Christmas carol movie the other day. It is an old movie and I don't remember much but the words thank you very much. It just got stuck in my head when I thanked a cashier at the store the other day."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","mind_body","I think I would opt for the body of a thirty year old. I have been smart for a long time and wouldn't mind being dumb or senile for awhile. It would be cool to be able to be in my eighties and run around like a young man."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","strangest","The strangest thing would have to be the number of opossums that are constantly around. There always seem to be possums roaming the neighborhood at night. Even after the built up the whole are and there were no woods left, there were still a ton of possums. They were super creepy to run into at night. "
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","religious","I am a religious person. I believe in God and the bible. I believe because I can feel the truth of it when I read the bible. I go to church and learn more every week. I enjoy being a christian, it is a great fellowship."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","friend_value","I just mostly like hanging out with familiar people. I like being able to be myself and joke around and have fun. I like having friends that I have known a long time and are easy to get along with. "
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","why_studies","I find them interesting to pass the time. I work some odd hours as I am on call for some IT functions and I like to see what the surveys are about. Every once in a while I get some small gift for myself with the money that I earn. It is a good way to spend your time when your bored."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","how_raised","I would send myself to private school instead of public school. School was boring and not challenging when I was a kid. The public schools are terrible, they spend most of their time on a few dumb kids. I would have rather gone to a private school and spent my days engaged in learning."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","famous","I would not like to be famous. The money they make would be great, but I don't want a bunch of people following me around and making a fuss. I think it would be terrible to not have privacy and always be under the microscope. It just is not worth the hassle to be famous. I don't have a big enough ego for being famous."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","garden","I have some flowerbeds with flowers and bushes. I usually will plant tomatoes and some kind of peppers every year in a small raised bed. I have tried other vegetables but they never do very well. The peppers are so much better than the stuff they sell at the supermarket."
"R_vZHCixPIvcTgWhr","fire_rescue","I would grab the pocket knife that my dad gave me when I was young. It was from his father and grandfather. It has a lot of personal value to me. It would be something that I could not replace after a fire."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","famous","I would like to become famous but not in the traditional national sense.  I would like to be famous more at a local level.  I would want to be known for my work with charity and how much I gave back to the community."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is the town was based on a groundhog.  Not many towns have a tradition where a groundhog predicts the weather once time each year.  While it is strange it does help connect with others."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","how_raised","I would change the size of the town I grew up in.  The town I grew up in was very small.  I learned a lot of small town values which I cherish, but I would have liked to grow up in a somewhat larger town so I had the ability to be around more culture and different types of people."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","why_studies","I do these online studies for a few different reasons.  I like the challenge they present.  I also like the extra money they are able to provide.  "
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","last_sing","I last sang to myself in the car on the way to work today.  I last sang to someone else when I sang to my girlfriend on the way home from dinner yesterday.  I tend to sing more when I'm in a good mood.  With a vacation almost here, I have been singing more times than not."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","cute_baby","I like it when I see children interact with animals at the zoo.  The cutest moments are when a child tries to communicate with the monkeys. I think it is cute because it is adorable but at the same times shows how intelligent young kids can be."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","friend_value","I value trust more than anything in a friendship.  Honestly is not something one can take for granted these days, and I very much appreciate someone I can trust.  If I can trust a person, I would consider them a good friend and someone I can go to at any time for help."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","religious","I am not a very religious person.  I was raised Catholic, but now lean more towards being agnostic.  I am open to the idea that there is a god and even sometimes pray to one, however I am not sure there is one based on science.  I live my life the way religious people do as I have a lot of similar values."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","garden","I don't have any fruit trees.  I live on two acres of land so I do have a lot of different plants.  I do grow a garden when the weather allows."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","mind_body","I would prefer to retain the mind.  I'm one of those people who believe you are as only as old as you feel, and I think it'd be easier to feel young with the mind of a 30 year old.  I value feeling sharp and wise and think that would come in more handy over the next 60 years more so than the body."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","fire_rescue","I would run in to save my phone.  I don't necessarily have everything on a cloud.  This means I would save all my pictures and contact info all in one small device rather than try to grab boxes and boxes of pictures which would be impossible in one dash."
"R_WfJ9uSYUDAlmiSl","like_work","I am the Controller at a printing plant.  I run the Finance Department while doing things like preparing financial statements and budgets.  I like that I have the ability to supervise people.  I also get to make my own hours and like that I contribute to the financial health of my company."
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","religious","No, I am not religious. I do not believe that our lives are controlled by an omnipotent higher being of whom there is not now or has never been any proof of existence. I firmly believe that we control and dictate our own lives. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","why_studies","I do them mostly because I enjoy them. I also find them challenging. I enjoy doing tasks that keep me busy and occupied. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","fire_rescue","I would save my 3D laptop as it is very precious to me. These laptops are one of a kind and hard to find. So it has a lot of sentimental value to me. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","friend_value","What I value most is loyalty. I think it's very hard to find true friendship these days. And loyal friends are even harder to find."
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","garden","Unfortunately, no. I don't currently live in a place that has the space for fruit trees or a garden. But someday I hope to live somewhere that does because I love gardens. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","how_raised","I would not actually change anything. I had a very idyllic childhood and very loving parents. I was also very popular in school and made friends easily. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","strangest","I had really strange neighbors. What made them strange was that they were very anti-social. They had a little boy but I hardly ever got to see him or play with him. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","like_work","I work as a legal assistant in a law firm. My work deals with assimilating data, researching cases and working with lawyers. I enjoy it because it is challenging. "

"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","famous","I would not really like to be famous. I value my privacy. But I would like to do a lot for animal welfare and establish an animal sanctuary for abandoned and unwanted animals. If this makes me famous in the course of my work then I do not mind. But I do not like to seek out fame merely for the sake of being famous. "
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen babies and children do is playing with toys. I also think they look adorable when they're sleeping or falling asleep. They look like little angels."
"R_WpNLHZWfdX9e5UJ","mind_body","I've met relatively old people who have sharp minds. So I think often times the mind is willing but the body is not. I think we retain to a large extent out mental abilities into old age. So I would choose having a fitter body as that is largely out of our control. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up what the border so close to the US. It was strange to enter Mexico and see all the poverty. I think that that was just a crazy experience for me to see. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","how_raised","I would have tried better in school. I was not raised to bring home mandatory A's like other kids were. However I do not regret the final outcome of my education because I ended up going to college. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","garden","I have a grapefruit tree. I also have an orange tree. I have Aloe Vera and lots of pretty flowers. I plan on growing herbs and veggies one day. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","mind_body","I would honestly want the body of a 30 year old so that I could still move around with ease. I think that being strong would really help me continue to live a happy healthy life. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","friend_value","What I value most in a friendship is loyalty. I think that having a best friend is important to me but being able to trust that person with anything is what really matters the most. Loyalty is the greatest thing a friend can offer. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","religious","Yes, I am religious because I think it keeps me in line with God and my moral values. I also think that the church social setting can be a very rewarding one when you are feeling low or are struggling with financial matters. Having people you can count on is very important and when family can't help the church will. "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","fire_rescue","I would take the photo album. I think that pictures are irreplaceable and are really all we have of each others special family memories. I would save my pictures because I can't replace them.  "
"R_wSPVaow5Hihht9D","why_studies","I like to do these studies because it pays me a little cash. Another main reason is because I have noticed that my computer skills are improving greatly. I also very much enjoy doing the fun surveys. "

I spend a lot of time out in the factory, helping train people, helping come up with new and more efficient ways of doing things - those sorts of things.  It's a really interesting place to work, and there's always challenges to overcome and problems to solve, which makes it more fun for me as I love those sorts of things."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","how_raised","When I was growing up, we didn't have a lot of money.  Both my parents worked hard, and I didn't get to spend a lot of time with them.  I'd change that - I'd have the sort of growing-up life that a lot of my friends had back then - where my mother would have been home during the afternoons when I got home from school, when my father wasn't so tired when he got home in the evening, and when we had enough money to buy whatever clothes and food and treats we wanted at the store.  "
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","famous","No, I wouldn't like to be famous.  I don't like being the center of attention, and I don't have a desire for people to admire me and look up to me like that.  I just like being myself - I don't need fame or riches or those sorts of things - just not attractive to me at all.  So nope, no fame desired here!"
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","friend_value","When it comes to friends, I like people who are honest - who are not afraid to be themselves.  I like people who are fun, but not risk-takers or troublemakers of any sort.  I value people I can do things with, hang out with - people who share some of my interests.  And who are good people - I think it's important that friends be kind, and nice, and the sort of people that I can enjoy myself and relax around."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","mind_body","I would probably retain the body of a 30 year old.  As I've gotten older I've seen my body already start to change for the worse.  My back hurts sometimes, my knees... and my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.  I've seen lots of 80 and 90 year old people who are still mentally sharp, but their bodies can't keep up. So I'd gamble that my mind would stay ok, and that having the body of a 30 year old would help me do all the things I'd still want to do as I aged.  Tough question though, since there are so many unknowns involved! "
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","strangest","I grew up in Newark, New Jersey.  My parents are immigrants, and we didn't have lots of money.  I think the strangest thing was driving around with my father, and he would point out places where there had been riots, or bad fires, or those sorts of things.  I live in rural New Hampshire now that I'm an adult, and looking back on my time in the inner city sure seems different now that I've been living surrounded by farmland and woods for so long."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","religious","No, I am not a religious person.  My parents never took me to church or talked about religion or god or anything like that when I was growing up, and so I wasn't raised religious.  My wife was raised Catholic when she was little, but moved away from that upbringing as she grew up, and so she's not religious either, and our son has never been to church.  Religion just isn't a part of my life."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","last_sing","I sing frequently to myself and to my family when I'm cooking dinner in the evening.  Sometimes I sing silly made-up songs like ""what are we going to eat tonight... what... what..."" and other times I sing songs I remember from my childhood or songs I hear on the radio.  Last night, I was listening to songs from the 1980s on my way home from work, so I was singing 80s songs in the kitchen while chopping vegetables and preparing chicken, while my wife was there with me.  In the car on the way home, I was singing along with the radio loudly, to myself.  I'm a lousy singer, but that doesn't stop me!"
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","fire_rescue","If my house caught fire and I could run in and save only one item, I would probably grab my wife's camera.  She takes a lot of photos of things we do together as a family, of places we go, of birds and wildlife - of just about everything.  Photography is her favorite thing, and saving her camera and making sure she'd still have that even though we'd lost everything else would mean a lot to her.  It would still be a huge loss, to lose everything else, but having that camera would make it just a little bit better."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","why_studies","I think these online studies are both fun and interesting.  They give me the opportunity to express my opinions, share my thoughts and values, and contribute to the research that's being done.  I've actually learned a lot from doing them, so it's been beneficial to me beyond just making a few dollars in payment now and then.  Plus, lots of the studies end up being about politics, and any time I have the opportunity through a political study to express my disgust and disappointment as related to the nightmare that is Donald Trump, I am happy to do so!  The chance to register my voice in opposition to what is going on in our country right now is a great side-benefit to participating in these studies."
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","garden","Yes, I do!  We have a big garden in our back yard, that we just expanded and fenced in this past summer!  I love gardening - we grow tons of vegetables, and my wife starts all our plants from seed.  I spend as much time outside in the summer as I can, working on the garden beds, weeding, and keeping everything healthy.  Every year we add new trees and bushes to our front yard too, as we're trying to help regrow the woods that used to be in our front yard and was cut down by the builder of the house many years ago.  It's a lot of fun, gardening!"
"R_x3YThFbEqFcHfu9","cute_baby","When my son was little, just two or three years old, he used to sing Christmas carols.  He always sang them really loud, with a big smile on his face the whole time.  And whenever he couldn't remember the words, he would make them up.  It was really cute - made me and my wife smile and laugh every time.  Just adorable!"

"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","why_studies","I started doing online studies because it was easy money.  I do an hour or so, sometimes more, daily on the studies because I enjoy to do them, too.  Yes, the easy money is a bonus, but honestly now I just also really enjoy to do them."
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","religious","No, I am not a religious person.  I was not brought up in a religious family, or household.  It is something that my family never got involved with, so I also choose as an adult not to get involved."
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","last_sing","Honestly, I do not sing to myself or anyone else.  Singing is not a passion of mine, it never has been.  I'm also pretty sure that no one else would enjoy my singing voice!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","garden","No, I do not have any fruit trees, or a garden.  I do however have outside plants in my landscape that are easy to take care of and maintain.  I do not have inside plants because I have cats who would terrorize them!  I would love someday to have a yard big enough for a garden though!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","friend_value","I value trust most in a friendship, as trust is something that is very hard to come by these days, it seems.  Trust is so easy to break,, and so hard to get back once it's broken, and it should be taken very seriously.  If you don't have trust, what do you have?"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","famous","I would love to be famous as someone who invented something outstanding, and something that would make a lasting impression on people.  I would love to have something that is known all over the world, and people all over the world would use.  Being rich with this would also be a huge bonus!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","strangest","I grew up in a neighborhood directly across the street from what's been named one of the most haunted places in the US.  Waverly Hills is a very creepy and strange place, and I can tell you that we had strange activity all of the time in our house, as well as neighbors would say the same.  Especially around Halloween time, there would be a lot of tourists in the area, checking it out."
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","fire_rescue","If my house were to catch fire and I had time to save one last item, I would pick my cedar chest that is in my bedroom.  My children are 11 and 15, and I have kept ""keepsakes"" for all of these years, which I keep in the cedar chest.  I have things from photo albums, to baby clothes, to first holiday things, and everything in between.  I would be devastated to lose all of that!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","cute_baby","Watching a baby laughing is the most adorable thing ever!  To see that innocent precious child laughing with a smile on his/her face is priceless, in my opinion.  A laughing baby can cheer anyone up, and if it doesn't, there's something wrong with you!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","mind_body","If I lived to be 90 years old, I would want to retain the mind of a younger person.  Looks aren't everything in life, but the mind is very valuable!  I would much rather look like an old lady and still have a sound mind and thought, so that hopefully I can enjoy life to the fullest!"
"R_XsV5vGFKKkkzJuN","how_raised","I was raised moving house to house because my mother couldn't always do it all on our own.  My father was (and still is) an alcoholic who would spend most, if not all at times, of his paychecks on liquor.  I wish that I would have had a more grounded household to grow up in, but at least I always had a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and food in my stomach."
"R_XTIaP7D4yqDu0LL","cute_baby","I honestly dont think children are cute. They are annoying and they dont have much appeal. I would prefer to not interact with them"

"R_XTIaP7D4yqDu0LL","why_studies","I do theses studies for some extra money. This is in order to support myself, and make it so i can have extra money to spend on special things i want. This is in oder for me not to spend money from my bussiness."
"R_XTIaP7D4yqDu0LL","strangest","Just how boring it was, there was nothing exciting about where i grew up. I was quite bored, and i did not have much to do. all I wanted to do was leave my parents house"

"R_XTIaP7D4yqDu0LL","mind_body","I would want to make sure i had the mind of a 30 year old. I fear my own mind degrading, and therefore i dont want to lose it. Diseases such as Alzheimer are things that i am afraid of "
"R_XTIaP7D4yqDu0LL","famous","No. I perfer to live in relative obscurity, and that lets me live without interacting with many people. Famous people have too much stress in their life"

"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","mind_body","I would rather retain my mind.  It wouldn't matter if I looked young, because my husband would be old.  I would rather be still able to function high cognitively.  "
"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","strangest","I think the strangest thing about where I grew up would be that it was a very small town.  My hometown was so small I had my parents as teachers.  I had my mom for elementary, and my dad for highschool."
"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","cute_baby","My bestfriends son is the cutest.  My mom was actually holding him up and bouncing him in the air the other day.  After being bounced around he spit up all down the front of my mom's blouse. "
"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","friend_value","I value trust most in a friendship.  Knowing that you have someone that you can rely on is key.  When I can trust a friend I know that I will keep them around. "
"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","fire_rescue","I would save my bible.  My bible was bought with my dad who recently passed away.  It has all kinds of notes in it, that would especially help me mentally after a fire. "
"R_xynIJHkAkhO7VzH","famous","I would not like to be famous in the sense of Holywood.  However, I do think it would be awesome to be famous for a social or intellectual movement.  If people associated my name with a great movement it would make me happy."

"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","mind_body","I would want to retain the body of a 30 year old so i could do what i wanted to do. changing my mind would make me feel like a different person. honestly i would not want to change anything."

"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","fire_rescue","I would save my grandmother's ring. She has passed away and it means a lot to me that it was given to me. i would not want it to be gone.that is something i could never replace."

"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is people have a really thick accent you can not understand well. it really was no that bad. it did not bother me much."
"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","why_studies","I do these online studies because i enjoy helping research and i find them interesting. I also do them because it is a good source of income for me. I get to stay at home with my kids."

"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","religious","Yes i am a religious person. I believe God does exist. One reason is because that is what i have been taught my whole life. Also it helps me have a sense of morals. "
"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","how_raised","There would be a few things I would change the way i was raised. I do not feel you should make children go to church if they do not want to. My parents were really strict on me and it caused me to crack under pressure. I had a good childhood but a few things could have bee n done differently. I wish my parents would not have fought so much."
"R_Ybj5Y1u15Lvcq1X","famous","I always wanted to be an actress when I was younger. as i got older i realized i was terribly shy. i would not mind having money but being famous is something i probably would not enjoy. I would rather be in the sidelines."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","why_studies","Well, I do online studies for a couple of reasons. One, they are fun when you get the right ones! I like to give my opinion on certain topics that I'm passionate about. Two, I like to make a little bit of money! Some of them pay you okay for your time."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","religious","I am a religious person. I believe in God. I am a religious person because I feel it is important, and God is real. I am very sure of that."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","fire_rescue","I would have to say that saving family pictures would be the one thing I'd save! There are many that could never be replaced. Pictures are a huge part of my memories. I want to keep them forever!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","famous","Actually, I would not like to be famous. I see how all of the famous people have to deal with pressure and being perfect in the spotlight at all times. All of that sounds so terrible to me! I'd prefer to live a quiet life in a small town with no pressure. Also, I would never want that kind of attention, I'm just not that type of person."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","friend_value","I value honesty more than anything else in a friendship. As long as a friend is honest, I think the friendship can last forever. I appreciate it when my friends respect what I say when I am being honest too. For instance, if I say I really don't feel like hanging out, I love when a friend accepts it and doesn't take offense."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","garden","I do! I have apple trees, many flowers and shrubs, and a garden. I love growing my own food. There is nothing more fresh or organic than picking the food you grew!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","like_work","I am a full time stay at home mom! I am very busy with my kids and have been doing volunteer work as well. I love more than anything that I get to be with my kids and raise them! I do not believe in sending your kids to daycare. They need raised by their parents!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","cute_baby","The cutest thing I've seen a baby or child do is one time my nine month old niece was eating in her high-chair and she fell asleep! It was so adorable to see her pass out on her carrots. I took a picture of it. I can't wait to show her when she is older!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","how_raised","Being completely honest, I would not change a thing! I was raised with two loving parents and a brother and sister. My parents did everything for us, they love us so much. I truly have been blessed beyond belief!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","last_sing","Well, I was just singing a song today! I got a country song stuck in my head, and I sang it over and over for a couple of hours. It took listening to a different song to get it out of my head. Now that I am thinking about it, I think it might get stuck in my head again!"
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","strangest","The strangest thing about where I grew up is that it was way out in the middle of nowhere! I loved it more than anything. There were no close neighbors and everyone knew everyone. I sure miss those days."
"R_yR62fIjtNIXJWwx","mind_body","I think I would rather keep my body. Getting old can be painful. Keeping the body of a 30-year-old would be helpful with that. It would be sad to not have the mind of a 30-year-old too, though!"
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","fire_rescue","It would have to by my photo album that goes back pretty far.  It has stuff from when my parents were kids all the way to nearly the present day.  Those are irreplacable even though many of them have been scanned and digitalized it's still important to me to have these original photos."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","friend_value","I think that honesty is the most important thing.  Treat me with the respect to be honest with me and I'll do the same.  From there stems all other genuine behaviors like trust and loyalty."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","famous","I think I would like a small level of fame.  So I'd like it in a way that I'm important to a certain group of people like an author or something.  I would still like to be able to go out in public and not get mobbed but occassionally be recognized would be fine."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","why_studies","I mostly do them for the extra money.  I mean to some degree they are interesting or stimulating because it would be hard to do these just for the pay since you are lucky to get 10 cents a minute working hard at it.  I do like the fact I can do them at my leisure.  That's an ideal way to suppliment your income."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","last_sing","I can't remember the last time I sang to someone else.  I think it was probably at my friends Birthday since we were all singing happy birthday to her last month.  I sang to myself this morning to Taylor Swift on the radio.  Should I be embarrased?  I'm not."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","how_raised","My parents were way too protective of me.  They sheltered me too much and I didn't really get other people like I should have.  We grew up in a really safe neighborhood too so it's not like it was physically dangerous for me to go off and do more stuff but they worried too much.  As a result I felt like as an adult I had to learn how to interact with people more than I should have."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","like_work","I've done all sorts of things but right now I'm a cashier at a retail department store.  We sell general merchandise at a fairly reasonable price.  I suppose what I like most about it is the flexibility.  I've never had problems getting time off or switching up my schedule when I needed to do so."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","religious","I used to be a religious person as a child and young adult.  I thought long and hard about it though and ultimately came to the conclusion that religion is something I was taught to believe without question.  As soon as I honestly questioned it there were too many things about it that weren't possible.  I guess you could say I outgrew it."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","strangest","I suppose it was a really rural suburban area when I first got there.  It was the up and coming neighborhood but it was far from built up so there was just lots of fields and nothing for a good long time.  The next town over was a metropolis compared to us which fortunately was only about 5 miles from where I lived."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","cute_baby","That's really tough.  I think the cutest thing though on a consistant basis is when a child errupts in a belly laugh.  Seeing a child experience joy like that is so much fun."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","mind_body","I would prefer to have my body not age.  I think there'd be a lot of downside to not aging mentally.  Sure it might mean I don't become senile (it's hard to say) but I think also not really growing intellectually or emotionally would be troublesome too.  Having a healthy body though would be key.  I'm guessing at age 90 I'd have a lot of aches and pains and I'd rather not have that.  Plus people judge you when you are older.  Hands down keeping a young body is the way to go."
"R_YYWJ9CPDJtVLQ1b","garden","Alas I don't have any trees or a garden but a few plants grow out front.  I occassionally take a leaf from the Aloe plant when I get sunburned or have a rash.  My friend has an awesome garden though and I often get veggies she grows from her."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","how_raised","I think that I would have wanted more discipline in high school. My parents just tried to do the bare minimum when it came to my interactions. If there was more discipline and guidance I might have a better relationship with them now."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","religious","I am somewhat of a religious person but mainly following holiday traditions. I pray at times but I do not follow the same rules that people adhere to. I believe in certain parts of the bible and others not so much."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","last_sing","I last sang to myself when I was in the shower the other night. I can't remember the last time I sung to another person. I do not like to let people hear me sing."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","cute_baby","I watched a little boy struggling to take his first steps. His mom was standing in front of him and he stood up and then fell. He tried again and then when he finally crawled over to his mom he was actually trying to just get the cookies that were sitting next to her."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","strangest","I think that the people that live where I grew up are pretty strange. It is a small town so their social interactions seem weird to me looking back. They seem really forced and just act strange when I visit home."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","fire_rescue","I would rush and take my TV. I just bought this TV and it would be relatively easy to carry. It is also not insured so I would not want to lose that money."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","mind_body","I would prefer to have the body of a 30 year old. I think the body has a higher chance to crap out first and with the younger body it would be easier to stay sound in my mind."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","famous","I would like to be known in the scientific community. I have been studying mushrooms and their benefits for a while. I would like to be able to write high profile articles. I think that would be a lot of fun though it would be work to be famous."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","like_work","I cook in a restaurant for a living. I like that it is a fast paced work environment. I also like the feeling of working together with a team. The feeling at the end of the night is pretty unique."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","why_studies","I like to feel like I am contributing to research. It is also interesting to me so see what is being studied at the moment as well. The monetary payment in exchange never hurts either."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","friend_value","I value loyalty most in a friendship. If I know that a person is loyal above all I can look past a lot of faults. A loyal friend is a rare thing these days."
"R_YYxPSeYViBpBcOZ","garden","I have a couple of plantain trees in my back yard. I also have nice potted plants that sit in my house. There is a big stretch of bamboo trees behind my house as well."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","cute_baby","Nothing. I don't notice these things and i used to babysit babies. I love kids and I love babies but I don't find them any cuter than anyone else and I haven't noticed anything cute they've done. If they did, it passed way over my head."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","famous","I don't want to be famous. On the contrary I value my anonymity. My parents were actors and they knew famous people, It cured me from ever wanting fame. I want my privacy and there isn't anything that would compel me to have one bit of fame."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","like_work","Right now I have a part time self-employed job working freelance jobs on the Internet. I do various jobs for different people and there's just too much variety to name it here. The good thing is that I am free to choose what I do and when I do it. The freedom is the best part of the experience."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","how_raised","I wouldn't change a thing. If anything changed, I wouldn't be the person I am today and I don't want that to happen. There was plenty of hard moments but they shaped me into what I am. So no way would I changed one iota of my childhood or how I was raised. Who knows what it would change afterwards and who I wouldn't meet because of it."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","strangest","I moved everywhere for three years. My parents decided to go to France when I was three and I lived in a hotel, in an apartment, with friends, in a trailer park. It was always changing. I don't remember any of it except for the smell of the bakery in front of the apartment. I guess it's not strange but it's unusual."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","mind_body","I'd rather keep my mind. I don't care about my body growing old as it's just part of life. I do care about my mind though because if I lose it then I won't be aware of anything. Being aware and being able to continue to create and have all my mental faculties would be important for my enjoyment of life itself."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","religious","No, I'm not. My parents had been forced into religion and they both decided they would let me choose what I wanted to be when I was eighteen. I tried by myself to learn about religion from different sourced. Friends and books and also school. Nothing ever made me feel that I was missing something. I remained unattached afterward.  "
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","friend_value","I've read the Three Musketeers when I was thirteen and that's where I take my values on friendship. A friend for me is someone you can trust, who will be there no matter what, who will go through hell with you and even if they are shaken by it won't let you go. Friendship is like love but without sex. I expect the person and myself to be completely devoted to each other."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","fire_rescue","It would be my pet monkey I've had since I was twelve. It's really old and really I don't need it anymore but it has sentimental value. I used to hug it when I was feeling low. It was there it good and bad times. So even though it's a kind of teddy bear, it became very dear to me. I guess I'd save it for nostalgia."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","why_studies","There are two reasons. I do need the money because I need to eat and that at least pays for that. But if I could choose there are some surveys I would do for free because they help me grow as a person and if I couldn't do them anymore I would miss it. So I do it for money and for personal growth. "
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","last_sing","I used to do that a lot, but I guess that the last time was a long time ago. I can't even remember. I sing in my head these days, not even out loud. Technically I sang Happy Birthday last month to my nephew, so that should count."
"R_zcZ5MjoFmjzFcaJ","garden","I have two plants that are dying. It's too hot here and I haven't managed to keep plants for long. I love plants and flowers but in Texas you must have to take a class on how to make them survive because they all die on me. Those two only have a few leaves left and I'm trying my best to keep them alive."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","how_raised","I would probably be a bit nicer to my parents. I sort of broke rules and was always giving them a hard time. If I had the opportunity I would go back and be a bit more respectful."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","fire_rescue","I would save the wristwatch my grandfather gave me. He wore it when he served overseas in our military. It is the one prized tangential possession I own. I make sure I always have it around, but never worn. It is one of the most prized possessions I think I will ever come across."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","famous","I would not like to be famous. The only thing I care about is that I helped progress our world. I do not need the glitz and glamour or recognition. As long as I did my job and made people feel happy, that's all I care about for the most part."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","like_work","I work for a large local bank. It is centered around one of the biggest metropolitan cities in the country. What I most like about it is being able to help people with their financial goals. I love seeing them when they have finally met objectives they were striving for."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","garden","No I do not. I am not a huge fan of raising things myself. I would much rather just go to the store and buy it rather than be responsible for the maintenance of the plants and such."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","last_sing","I sang to myself this morning on the car ride to work. It's something that I almost always do. The last time I sung to someone else was probably a year ago when my daughter was crying and could not go to sleep."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","cute_baby","My own son used to curl up like a fetus at night when he went to sleep. He never rolled on his back or slept outstretched for the most part. He looked like he wanted to go back in his mother's womb considering he was always in that position."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","mind_body","I would want to retain the mind of a 30-year-old. Too often we see incurable diseases take the minds of great people. I would want to know I was still a sharp tool in the toolbox for as long as I grace this Earth."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","religious","No I am not a religious person. I do not think that organized religion is the way to go. No one person can say they know what is going on. I would call myself spiritual, but not to the point where I would go to a church and profess my love for God."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","strangest","Where I grew up had this large backyard. That's not so strange. But what is strange was the amount of homeless people that lived all the way in the back of it by the creek. We would throw trash and dog waste down there and they would come and go as they pleased, sometimes retreating there for weeks. I could not imagine how bad it smelled down there, especially in the week. It was also strange because certain times of the year, the water from the small creek would just disappear."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","friend_value","I would say honesty. It is important to be able to confide in someone all the time. You need that shoulder to lean on in times of frustration and you always want someone by your side."
"R_zeeVjsW5NOJpG8N","why_studies","I do these to help science and research. I think it is very important to have a progressive society. We should always leave this planet in better shape than we came in. This is how we evolve and research and studies like this give people the chance to help out and get a glimpse into our minds."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","strangest","Probably the number of rednecks. It was a very, very white town and very simple folks that are ""set in their ways"". Nobody had any urge to grow up and leave the community and I thought that was pretty strange."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","like_work","I am a Senior IT Analyst. I like writing programs and creating useful tools for people to use. I also enjoy writing code and seeing the array of things that are possible with technology."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","friend_value","I value honesty the most in any friendship. It is very difficult to find honest people and I don't think friendship is possible without it. I have had very few friendships because of this."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","why_studies","I don't know if anybody does these studies because they are interesting; I do them for the supplemental income. Don't get me wrong, I do find most to be interesting but probably wouldn't be here if the money didn't come with it. My income is fairly high but a little extra never hurts."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","mind_body","I would go with my mind. I think body matters but living to 90 with a bad body wouldn't be so bad if possible but losing a mind seems terrible. I've seen the mind-losing side of things and it isn't pretty but have yet to see a 90 year old hold onto a decent body."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","last_sing","Oh goodness, I probably sung to myself last week. I typically have a few drinks on the weekend and listen to music and get in the mood to sing. I haven't sang to somebody else since high school."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","how_raised","I would change growing up poor. My family did not have a lot of money and my dad was the only one that worked and he didn't earn a lot. He never wanted my mom to work and felt her place was at home."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","garden","Yes, I have plenty. I have one apple tree planted in the front yard that somehow produces apples each year. I also have many shrubs of different varieties planted around my yard. Mostly for privacy screens but they look nice also."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","cute_baby","That's tough; I don't care much for babies or children. I do enjoy seeing kids swear because I like to swear. I guess it's cute when little children swear because it isn't something one would expect to come out of a child."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","famous","Not in the least. I am not a person that likes attention and I don't think having so many eyes on me would be appealing. I am also working to make my life simpler instead of more complicated so I think fame would only send that in the other direction."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","fire_rescue","Probably a bottle of rum. Something tells me that I would need a drink after losing everything. Not that I'm an alcoholic, I would just appreciate something to take the edge off of such a life-changing event."
"R_ZIW4uexhgaRLIiJ","religious","No, I am not religious at all. I don't believe in any god or afterlife. I don't consider myself an atheist either because I feel they have their own agenda where I have no agenda or urge to change how people think or feel or fight about the issue. I'm not sure why I feel this way; I think maybe because I have thought about it a lot and I think science has more answers than religion. I also do not fear death or need to make up stories to make death easier."
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","last_sing","I sing to my cat. I used to sing him a song every day when I fed him, and then we got a new neighbor on the other side of the kitchen wall. Then I realized I could hear all her conversations so not only could she hear my singing but the previous neighbor could too. I stopped singing. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","how_raised","I was an only child. I hated it. I was lonely when I was young and I hated being home. It made me extremely social but at the same time I'm jealous. I never had to share attention or my parents and I can't cope when my partner is focused on anyone else. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","why_studies","I'm disabled. I'm waiting for a transplant and I can't work for awhile. I hate sitting around but I'm too tired to do anything. These keep me focused on something other than me. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","strangest","I grew up in a secluded rural area but the schools were terrible. So I went to private school two towns over. It was annoying because I couldn't just ride bikes to my friends houses or walk home with them. I couldn't go play at other houses without a lot of planning. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","like_work","I was a preK/ kindergarten teacher. It was great feeling like I was getting kids off to a great start in life. I loved working with families. When I became a director and administrator, it stopped being fun. I had to work with adult staff and paperwork instead of kids. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","mind_body","I think it would be torture to have a young mind and an old body that can't keep up. It might be kind of fun to have a young body but the attitude that older people can get, when they don't care what people think. They just speak their mind with no fear of consequences. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","garden","We live in an apartment so there is no plot to garden. The place we are looking to move into has garden plots. I actually saw a pineapple plant recently in a pot that looked really cool to own. I would love that. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","cute_baby","When I worked in a preschool I saw a kid crash into another kid on their trikes. When the kid who got hit complained, the other one apologized. He said, ""I didn't even see you! I was on my cell."""
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","religious","I was raised in a really religious environment. We were not taught to think for ourselves. Religion class when I was young was literally memorizing scripture and prayers. It was just rote memorization and no real discussion about morals or ethics or theology. I'm not religious at all now. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","famous","I think it's really cool the way celebrities are famous for acting. I would love to have fans always telling me they love the work I do. But it would be hard to be so famous that you feel like you can never go anywhere. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","fire_rescue","I would want my engagement ring since I don't wear it. It was my grandmother's. I keep it safe so nothing happens to it but I would definitely want it. "
"R_ZKuHVznHtNRmmMp","friend_value","My closest friend is the one who is always consistent with me. If we don't talk for a little bit or something happens, we still pick up right where we left off. It's like nothing changes between us. We are both going through huge upheavals in our lives right now but our friendship is the same. "
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","fire_rescue","I ran back inside the house to get some personal items. Especially a box that keeps almost all of my pictures in it. They are pictures of my son and family over the years."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","religious","I was raised up Baptist, but my dad went to a Methodist college in Missouri. I believe in god and something after, but I think god has a sense of humor in this life. He doesn't have our lives planned out, but he enjoys watching us get there."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","friend_value","I don't have many close friends. The people I do consider friends are the people I can count on whenever I need them or if they need me. Usually just somebody to talk to or listen, or sometimes advice, but I know their there for me one hundred percent. "
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","why_studies","I like to do them to stay busy. They also keep your mind working, thinking about a different scenario, or actually putting thought into different choices. It helps they pay you also, that is a big plus."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","how_raised","I grew up with just my dad and my brothers. Life was pretty good, my dad was an excellent father. My brothers and I did get into some trouble, but mostly it was just a lot of fun, because he was at work a lot. I really miss my mom, and I wish she had been in the picture a lot more when we were growing up."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","mind_body","I want to keep my mind going for as long as I can, because as you know they say that's the first thing to go. I would feel like a burden, my body would be fine, but if there wasn't anything upstairs, you would need help, and I wouldn't want to ask or burden my friends or family."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","like_work","I am a store manager for Walgreens. I have some really great people working for me and I really like the position and benefits. You learn a lot from working in a pharmacy, and you meet quite a few interesting people. I get to interact and help people on a daily basis, and that is really nice."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","garden","I used to plant a garden every year, but now I only plant a few things. I like to plant flowers near the porch during the spring. I also love tomatoes so always have a tomato plant every year, from cherry tomatoes to roma."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","strangest","We had a farm next to the Osage river and every year it would flood. The house was about a thousand feet from the river and there was a corn field in between. After the river flooded there was always pockets or puddles of big fish in there that we would try to catch by hand. We never really caught more than a few the whole time we lived there."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","last_sing","I like to sing while I'm working out, it helps get the mood set. I listen to some pretty fast beats, and hard songs so it comes out kind of loud and crazy. I don't sing in the shower, but I will sing along to the radio as I'm driving down the road."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","cute_baby","When my son was around five or six years old, he would do some of the craziest, cutest stuff. One thing that sticks in my mind, He would grab a trash bag from the kitchen and wear it like a jacket. He would then go out and just run and dance in the rain forever, or until I made him come back inside."
"R_ZlqmTuARlyzubi9","famous","I don't know if I would like to be famous. The money would be really awesome and having your picture everywhere or everybody knowing your name. You also have to deal with all the crazy people, and paparazzi, and everybody being in your business, know what your doing."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","famous","Wow! Interesting question. It's actually come up a few times before. The short answer is no. That's funny, because the last person who asked, somewhat differently phrased - she thought that I already was - got the response, ""Because everyone wants to touch you."" She thought that funny. Well, I don't."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","why_studies","I love coin collecting games; like Bejeweled Blitz. Surveys are similar. But, I also do them to see where the mass consciousness is."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","friend_value","Mostly, I value understanding. That has many aspects. Also, the ability to understand what's unsaid,... As if it's obvious."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","last_sing","To someone else; well, that was probably quite some time ago, while driving. I think we were singing together, though. Actually, I sing to myself in the shower. I hear different sounds, music, even choirs, so I sing along, or hum along."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","cute_baby","Just them being themselves. That's already cute. But the last time that I recall, there was a small child wearing a backpack marching through the cafe where I was reading. Now that was funny!"
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","how_raised","Actually I wouldn't. I have fond memories of growing up. Everything was middle class, but the memories are clear and sharp. I wouldn't trade that for anything."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","religious","I am NOT! And anyone who is, is assigning all their ability and power to an external entity, which is not themselves. I just feel.that that's wrong."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","fire_rescue","Well, I assume I already have my keys and wallet in my pocket. I'd grab my laptop. I'd put it in my backpack and get out. Hope you don't mind that my Kindle is already in there. As I already mentioned, I'm a software engineer. Don't know what I'd do without my computer."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","garden","I live in a condo, so,maybe. There's a lawn out back. But I used to live with a friend in a big house, and he was into plants and trees. So I learned quite a bit about mangoes, neem trees, and of course, about various palms."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","strangest","The strangest thing was that it was a long time ago. It was a big multicultural city. I remember sitting on the front stoop on a foggy day. Then this woman, walking along the street, greeted my in french. She was friendly (thinking back), but I was scared. I was really young."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","like_work","I'm retired now. But, I'm a software engineer... A programmer / analyst, as we used to say. It's in my blood. It's what I am. I'm programming something or other just about every day. I really love that I can design something, and see the results almost immediately."
"R_ZmozNVpKpkoEr7P","mind_body","Hmmm; I guess that I look younger than I am. I'd go with body. But, in truth, I don't think that the two are separable. By the way, I'm almost there now, and both are in fine condition. Thanks for asking."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","mind_body","I would want to keep my mind the longest. I think that being older you realize that your body can only do so much even as a 30 year old, but your mind can take you pretty far. The mind is what keeps you functioning."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","like_work","I am a supervisor for a non profit. I like that I get to help people help people. We all have the best time brainstorming ideas to implement and then we get to enjoy seeing others benefit from our work."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","why_studies","I do them because they help me to understand myself better. It allows me to lay out what I think and believe. I think that they are useful in organization in my life."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","how_raised","I would change that my parents weren't so young and had an education. I think that is what contributed to them not parenting me in a way that I needed. They also didn't pass the importance of a good education to better ourselves."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","garden","I do not have and fruit trees, plant, or a garden, but would like them in the future. I work full time and lead a busy lifestyle that I wouldn't be able to give it the proper care and attention it needs. I will have one one day when my life is less busy."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","cute_baby","The cutest thing is when babies blow bubbles. They learn a new thing and then they just keep doing it. The little spit bubbles are cute and they tend to do that when they are happy."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","friend_value","I value that the person wants a relationship with me for no than reason than they enjoy my company. I think friendship is rare and special and when you have it you cherish it. Knowing that the friend is there for me in good times and bad gives me a steady system of support."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","famous","I would not like to be famous, because I am an extremely private person. I also don't think that you can truly trust anyone because you wouldn't know who was really for you. I think that with fame there is a price to pay and for me it isn't worth it."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","religious","I am a Christ follower. I wouldn't say that religion defines me but the relationship inside that religion that matters. I am a christian because I know that I was meant to have communion with God but that relationship was broken because of sin. Jesus bridged the gap between the fellowship of God and man."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","fire_rescue","I would save a family photo album that has all of the pictures of my children and our family growing up. They are precious time and memories for us. This would be the one thing I would go after."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","last_sing","I sang in the car yesterday as I was going to work. My son was dropping me off and we were riding in the car together listening to the radio. It made me happy and put me in a good mood."
"R_zSRPmWxruQVuYlH","strangest","I grew up in Memphis, TN and the strangest thing about growing up there is that the community is pretty transient. People move as they move up in status so you are always getting new neighbors so there isn't a sense of neighborhood. I think this strange because I now see that having community is what helps society be better."
